### Short Squeeze – TSLAQ Graveyard
Remember when Gordon Johnson predicted Tesla's bankruptcy by 2020, calling it a "zero" stock, or Jim Chanos labeled it overvalued with no real tech edge, while David Einhorn shorted it hard expecting collapse, and Mark Spiegel ranted about "FSD fraud" that would never materialize? Fast forward to November 18, 2025: TSLA trades at $401.25 with a market cap soaring past $1 trillion, Robotaxi fleets are deploying in test cities with regulatory nods, Cybertruck sales have exceeded 500,000 units globally amid record deliveries, and FSD v14.1.7 rolls out with 3D buildings and Tron Mode proving autonomous progress that's burying those doomsayers in a graveyard of failed predictions—shorts are getting squeezed again as reality crushes their outdated FUD.

Today I challenge you to share a photo of your Tesla with the latest software update screen and tag why you're diamond-handed.
