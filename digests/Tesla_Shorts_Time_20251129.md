📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers continue to feel the burn as Tesla defies doomsday predictions year after year. Remember the 2019 calls for Tesla's imminent bankruptcy, like analyst David Trainer's warning of financial collapse (https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/05/20/tesla-headed-for-bankwuptcy/)? Or Gordon Johnson's repeated forecasts of demand cliffs from 2020-2023, all proven wrong as deliveries soared (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4655454-tesla-stock-gordon-johnson-wrong-again)? Even in 2025, bears betting against FSD progress are watching shares climb, reminding us that underestimating Elon's vision has cost shorts billions—long live the squeeze!
