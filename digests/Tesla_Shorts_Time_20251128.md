📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers continue to feel the burn as Tesla defies bearish predictions year after year. Remember Gordon Johnson's 2020 forecast that Tesla would go bankrupt amid production woes? It backfired spectacularly as Model 3 ramped up, with TSLA surging over 700% that year (reference: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/tesla-short-sellers-lost-38-billion-in-2020-as-stock-surged.html). In 2022, Jim Chanos bet big against Tesla's "overvaluation," only to close his fund in 2023 after massive losses as shares rebounded (reference: https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jim-chanos-shutter-hedge-funds-after-39-year-run-ft-2023-11-17/). Fast-forward to 2025, and predictions of Cybertruck failure have crumbled with international deliveries starting, squeezing shorts further as Tesla's market cap climbs—proving once again that betting against innovation is a losing game.
