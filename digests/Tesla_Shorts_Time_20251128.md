📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers continue to feel the burn as Tesla defies doomsday predictions year after year. Back in 2020, bears like Jim Chanos forecasted Tesla's bankruptcy amid production woes, but the stock surged over 700% that year alone (source: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/tesla-short-sellers-lost-38-billion-in-2020-as-stock-surged.html). In 2022, skeptics bet big against Tesla during supply chain crunches, only to lose billions as Cybertruck hype and FSD advancements propelled shares higher (reference: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/tesla-short-sellers-pile-on-as-stock-rebounds-from-2022-lows). Fast-forward to 2025, with failed calls on EV market saturation ignored by global expansions like Cybertruck deliveries in South Korea—short interest remains high, but Tesla's resilience keeps squeezing the pessimists out.
