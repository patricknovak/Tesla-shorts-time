📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers continue to feel the burn as Tesla defies their gloomy forecasts year after year. Remember when bears predicted Tesla's bankruptcy in 2020 amid production woes, only for the stock to surge over 700% that year thanks to record deliveries and profitability (reference: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/tesla-tsla-2020-annual-vehicle-deliveries.html)? Or the 2022 claims that rising interest rates would crush EV demand, yet Tesla hit 1.8 million deliveries in 2023 (reference: https://investor.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-vehicle-production-deliveries-and-date-financial-results-5)? Fast-forward to 2025, and predictions of FSD regulatory failure have been squashed by global rollouts, leaving shorts nursing massive losses as TSLA climbs—proving once again that betting against Tesla is a losing game.
