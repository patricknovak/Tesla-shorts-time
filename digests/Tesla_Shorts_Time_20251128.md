📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers have faced epic pain betting against Tesla, with TSLA soaring over 1,000% since 2020 despite doomsday predictions. Bears like Jim Chanos famously predicted Tesla's demise in 2020, calling it a "fraud" amid bankruptcy fears, but the stock exploded post-split (reference: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/tesla-stock-split-jim-chanos-says-hes-still-bearish.html). In 2022, critics forecast EV demand collapse due to inflation, yet Tesla delivered record vehicles, squeezing shorts for billions (reference: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-03/tesla-short-sellers-lose-40-billion-in-2022). By 2025, failed bets on FSD delays ignored rapid updates like V14, leaving bears underwater as autonomy nears (reference: https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-tsla-elon-musk-full-self-driving-fsd/).
