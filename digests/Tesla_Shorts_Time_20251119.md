## Short Squeeze
In the ongoing Tesla short squeeze saga, skeptics like those from Citron Research predicted in early 2025 that TSLA would plummet below $200 due to EV market saturation, but shares soared past $400 amid Robotaxi wins, proving their bearish bets wrong as autonomy hype drove gains [Failed Prediction Link](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/15/citron-short-tesla-prediction.html). Similarly, analyst Gordon Johnson's $150 price target from GLJ Research failed spectacularly as AI integrations and regulatory approvals boosted sentiment, highlighting how underestimating Tesla's innovation leads to massive short losses [Failed Prediction Link](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4678923-glj-research-tesla-target.html). These misfires demonstrate the perils of betting against visionary progress, turning shorts into fuel for Tesla's upward momentum.
