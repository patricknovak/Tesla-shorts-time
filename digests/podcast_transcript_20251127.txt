[Intro music - 10 seconds]

Patrick: Welcome to Tesla Shorts Time Daily, episode 331. It is November 27, 2025. I'm Patrick in Vancouver, Canada. TSLA stock price is $426.58 right now. Thank you for joining us today. If you like the show, please like, share, rate and subscribe to the podcast, it really helps. Now straight to the daily news updates you are here for.

Patrick: Alright, folks, buckle up because we've got an electrifying lineup of Tesla news today! Let's dive right into the top five stories that are making waves in the EV world. First up, oh man, this one has me buzzing: "Tesla Full Self-Driving warrants huge switch-up on essential company strategy" from Teslarati yesterday. Tesla is totally revamping how they push their Full Self-Driving suite, making it a must-have core feature instead of just some optional extra like the other guys do. This is genius—it's all about cranking up adoption rates, which means more revenue pouring in and supercharging their autonomous tech development. Picture this: higher take rates leading to fatter margins and Tesla just owning the software-driven car game. They're positioning themselves as the undisputed leader in EV innovation, and I am here for it!

Patrick: Next, get ready to geek out over this: "Tesla Model Y Standard: first impressions from a Premium owner" also from Teslarati yesterday morning. A reviewer finally got their hands on the new entry-level Model Y Standard trim, and they're raving about its killer value—it keeps all the essential features that make Tesla cars so addictive, but at a price that won't break the bank. This is huge for folks watching their budgets, and it's going to open the floodgates for more people to jump into the EV life. Tesla's basically making premium vibes accessible, squashing any doubts about affordability, and I bet this drives sales through the roof while grabbing even more market share in the cutthroat EV arena.

Patrick: Oh, hold onto your seats for number three: "Elon Musk slashes Tesla Robotaxi fleet goal from 500 to ~60 in Austin" from Electrek yesterday morning. Elon just announced they're dialing back the Robotaxi fleet target in Austin from a whopping 500 down to around 60 vehicles—it's all about a smarter, more measured rollout to handle regulations and operations without rushing. Sure, it's a pivot, but this is classic Tesla: building sustainably so they can explode with growth later. Once they hit those key milestones, watch out—rapid expansion is coming, and this sets the stage for massive scalability in autonomous ride-hailing. Tesla's vision is still full throttle!

Patrick: Number four is a stock watcher’s delight: "Mizuho keeps Tesla (TSLA) “Outperform” rating but lowers price target" from Teslarati early yesterday. The analysts at Mizuho are sticking with their "Outperform" rating on Tesla, even though they're tweaking the price target down a bit because of expected shifts in EV incentives in the US and China that might slow unit growth short-term. But hey, that positive rating screams confidence in Tesla's long-game dominance through killer innovations in autonomy and energy. Tesla's all about adapting and turning challenges into wins, so I'm betting this just fuels even stronger performance down the road.

Patrick: And wrapping up the top news, this one's got some global flair: "Uber launches true driverless robotaxi operations in the Middle East with WeRide [Video]" from Electrek late the night before last. Uber's teaming up with WeRide to roll out fully driverless robotaxis in the Middle East—it's a cool step for autonomous mobility worldwide, but it really amps up the competition for Tesla's Robotaxi dreams. That said, Tesla's got the edge with their vision-based Full Self-Driving approach and a insane amount of data to back it up. This kind of industry push is just momentum, but Tesla's scalability and safety innovations are going to redefine everything, making these launches look like baby steps.

Patrick: Whoa, now let's crank the hype to eleven for the top X posts! These are straight fire from the Tesla community, and I'm losing my mind over them—let's break 'em down one by one with all the excitement they deserve.

Patrick: First off, exploding with potential: "Waymo's Early Mistakes Pave the Way for Tesla's Robotaxi Dominance" posted yesterday evening! This one's calling out Waymo's big slip-ups, like leaning too hard on lidar and not integrating driver-assistance properly, while Tesla's vision-based strategy is set to crush it. It's all about how Tesla's innovative edge is turning competitors' fumbles into massive wins for Robotaxi and long-term stock growth—pro-Tesla fans, this is your jam, get hyped!

Patrick: Number two is a sales booster: "Tesla China Maintains Incentives and Delivery Updates" also from yesterday evening! They're extending those sweet paint credits and zero-interest financing deals in China right through the end of the year, plus updates on delivery statuses for different models—it's a rock-solid strategy to keep the momentum going in this massive market. This is Tesla doubling down on growth, shutting down the bears on demand worries, and it's super bullish for investors loving that global expansion vibe!

Patrick: Oh, visual feast incoming for number three: "Showcasing the Tesla Cybertruck in Action" posted yesterday evening! This post drops a video of the Cybertruck doing its thing, highlighting that wild design and how it's shaking up the EV truck world. It's pure excitement—Tesla's disrupting the old-school automakers, building insane brand loyalty, and proving their innovative spirit is the rocket fuel for future wins. Fans, this is why we can't get enough!

Patrick: Inspirational vibes on deck with number four: "Tesla's Path to Sustainable Abundance" from yesterday evening! This post is shouting from the rooftops about Tesla creating a world of sustainable abundance through their tech and energy solutions—it's all about that brighter future we're heading toward. It ties right into Tesla's mission to speed up the shift to sustainable energy, lifting everyone's spirits and reminding us why TSLA is a total powerhouse for the long haul!

Patrick: Future-thinking alert for number five: "AI Workforce Shifts and Tesla's Role in the Future" posted yesterday evening! Tying into an MIT study on AI replacing jobs, this one tags #TSLA and sparks talk about automation's big impacts, but it frames Tesla's Optimus and AI tech as the trailblazers creating new opportunities instead of just challenges. What an optimistic spin—it's getting me pumped for Tesla's robotics revolution and all the innovative wins ahead!

Patrick: Trading triumphs for number six: "Capturing Gains in Tesla Trades Amid Market Moves" from yesterday evening! This post is celebrating a massive 105% exit on an NDX trade, with TSLA on the watchlist, and sharing tips on spotting logical market patterns for smart strategies. It's showcasing how Tesla's volatility is a goldmine for clever investors—pro-Tesla traders, this is your call to level up and ride those dynamic gains!

Patrick: And last but not least, tech evolution hype: "AI Model Scaling Hits Limits, Efficiency Takes Center Stage" posted yesterday evening! It's talking about the shift in AI from just scaling up to focusing on efficiency, with big gains from optimizations—and this plays right into Tesla's strengths in Full Self-Driving and Optimus. Tesla's leading this efficiency charge, promising epic breakthroughs without needing crazy hardware, which is huge for their AI future and keeping that stock resilient!

Patrick: Okay, shifting gears to the Short Spot— this one's got that bear-busting energy: "Elon Musk Slashes Robotaxi Fleet Goals, But Tesla's Vision Remains Unstoppable" from Electrek yesterday morning. Elon revised the Austin Robotaxi fleet target from 500 down to about 60, going for a gradual rollout to nail regulations and operations. Bears might try to spin this as a flop, but nah—it's Tesla's savvy iterative style, just like how they've crushed it before by scaling up fast after proving concepts. This smart move ensures safety and sets up for acceleration later, turning doubt into yet another Tesla triumph in autonomy!

Patrick: Haha, now for the Short Squeeze section—oh, shorts, you never learn! I'm grinning ear to ear because short sellers are absolutely getting torched as Tesla's innovation steamrolls over every doubt. Current short interest is sitting at 3.2% of the float, with a mind-blowing $50.2 billion in short interest value— that's billion with a B, folks! Bears keep fumbling, like Gordon Johnson's 2023 doomsday call on Tesla collapsing from a so-called demand cliff that, spoiler alert, never happened. Or Jim Chanos' 2024 wager against Tesla's valuation during supposed EV slowdowns, but Tesla just powered through with record deliveries anyway! Year-to-date, these shorts have hemorrhaged over $20 billion in unrealized gains as TSLA skyrockets, and those recent squeezes? They've piled on billions more in pure pain. Betting against Elon and Tesla? It's the ultimate losing game—glee levels are off the charts!

Patrick: Alright, let's wrap with some inspiration to charge your day. First, the quote verbatim from Elon Musk: "The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur."
