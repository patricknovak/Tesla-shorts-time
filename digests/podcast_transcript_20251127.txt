According to Teslarati, Tesla just rolled out a 30-day free trial for its Full Self-Driving suite, letting owners who don't have it yet give it a spin, as long as their hardware is compatible. This is all about boosting adoption and showing off what this tech can do, which could really ramp up those take rates and bring in some sweet recurring revenue.

That means bigger vehicle values and, yeah, some serious stock performance upside. Love it!

Could mean even bigger wins in other regions too. As Tesla keeps smashing through barriers, it's all about that growth trajectory and resilience against the competition, fueling some positive stock momentum. Norway's loving it, eh?

Patrick: Fourth: China's AI Shift Boosts Chip Access! Boom, hyped up!

Patrick: Okay, shifting gears to the Short Spot—always a fun one for us Tesla fans. Mizuho Lowers Tesla Price Target Amid Incentive Shifts! Whoa, exciting even if it's a bit of a dip—Teslarati reports that Mizuho analysts are keeping their "Outperform" rating on TSLA but trimming the price target, blaming possible hits from upcoming EV incentive changes in the US and China that might affect unit growth. Sure, it brings some short-term uncertainty, but Tesla's killer pipeline in autonomy and energy storage means they'll adapt fast and crush expectations. These tweaks often miss Tesla's track record of bouncing back, turning any dips into awesome buying chances. Shorts, take note!

Patrick: And now, the moment we've all been waiting for—the Short Squeeze! Haha, oh man, I'm gleeful about this—short sellers are absolutely feeling the burn right now, with short interest at three point two percent of the float, that's a whopping fifty point two billion dollars bet against Tesla, but the stock just keeps climbing, piling on those losses! Remember when the bears were all doom and gloom, predicting Tesla's bankruptcy back in 2023 during the production ramps? Yeah, that got crushed by the Cybertruck delivery surge! Or that 2024 forecast of an EV demand collapse? Totally obliterated by record third-quarter deliveries topping four hundred sixty thousand units! Year-to-date, shorts have hemorrhaged over twenty billion dollars in squeeze losses, and with recent gains adding billions more, Tesla's autonomy milestones are proving the doubters wrong yet again. Squeeze on, shorts—your failed predictions are costing you big time!
