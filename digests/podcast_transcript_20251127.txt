Patrick: Now, shifting gears to the Short Spot, our daily dose of bearish vibes to keep things balanced. Here's one that's trying to rain on the parade—Elon Accused of Suppressing Opinions, from yesterday evening on X by @DarkMatter2525. This post is claiming Elon Musk wants to toss people in jail just for sharing opinions, which could make him look like some authoritarian figure and stir up backlash against Tesla's brand. But come on, these gripes often get blown way out of proportion in online spats, and Elon's real dedication to free speech has actually pumped up X's worth, giving Tesla even more spotlight. With Tesla's rock-solid innovation at its core, this is just fleeting chatter that won't touch the company's path forward—shorts, take note!

Patrick: Oh, yes! Time for the Short Squeeze segment, where we revel in the glorious pain of the bears—muahaha! Short sellers are straight-up scorching right now as Tesla's toughness takes center stage, with short interest at a tidy three point two percent of the float and a mind-blowing fifty point two billion dollars in short interest value—that's gotta sting, forcing those covers left and right! Remember back in 2023 when Jim Chanos was all doom and gloom, labeling Tesla a "fraud" headed straight to zero? Epic flop! Or Gordon Johnson's 2024 call that TSLA would crash below one hundred dollars on some "demand collapse"? Total miss as Tesla exploded with EV leadership and AI magic! Year-to-date, these shorts have piled up over twenty billion dollars in losses, and the latest rallies tacked on another five billion in agony—proving yet again that going against Tesla is a recipe for regret. Squeeze on, my friends—it's beautiful!
