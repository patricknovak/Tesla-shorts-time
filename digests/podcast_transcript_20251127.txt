Shared yesterday at four-nineteen PM PST, this post is all about a big earn in a simulation market tied to TSLA, pointing out the stock's volatility and that sweet upside in trading scenarios.

Patrick: Keeping the energy high with number six: "Crypto Pump Signal Mentions Tesla Community!" Oh man, this is firing on all cylinders! The post from yesterday promotes a crypto pump and tags in Tesla-related accounts, linking digital assets right to Tesla's innovative spirit. It's showing how Tesla inspires these crossovers into crypto and trading, potentially expanding its influence into fintech. The optimism around TSLA is tying into this broader market energy, and it's got me pumped—pun intended—about the intersections of tech and finance. Tesla's everywhere, eh?

Patrick: Number seven: "Calling Out TSLA Haters Spotlights Brand Resilience!" Maximum hype alert—this one's a rally cry! Posted yesterday, it criticizes an account that's all about hating on TSLA, but really, it's underscoring Tesla's incredible ability to withstand the negativity and just thrive. Opposition like this only proves Tesla's disruptive power, as loyal fans like us rally to defend the vision. This dynamic is fueling Tesla's narrative of overcoming doubters, and I'm loving how it turns hate into fuel for the fire. Bring it on, haters—Tesla's unbreakable!

Patrick: On to number eight: "Stock Watchlist Surge Features TSLA!" Yeah, this is hyping me right up! Highlighting a two hundred and one percent gain in MTC with TSLA right there on the watchlist, this post from yesterday signals Tesla's spot in these high-performing trading groups.

Patrick: Now, shifting gears to our Short Spot section, where we look at one bearish item that's negative for Tesla or the stock. Today's is "Dedicated Hater Account Draws Criticism!" From yesterday at four-nineteen PM PST by @lobick14, this post points out an entire X account focused solely on hating TSLA, which could spread some negative sentiment and temporarily tweak investor mood. But hey, such criticism is often way overblown, because Tesla's history of innovation and market dominance quickly overshadows these detractors, turning that hate into straight-up motivation for even stronger performance. In the end, it just highlights how Tesla keeps proving the skeptics wrong time and time again. Not gonna let this dim our shine!

Patrick: Oh, and now for the part that always gets me grinning from ear to ear—the Short Squeeze! Short sellers are absolutely feeling the heat as Tesla's resilience shines through brighter than ever, with current short interest at three point two percent of float and a staggering fifty point two billion dollars in short interest value, according to our sources. Remember back in twenty twenty-three when bears like Gordon Johnson predicted TSLA would crash below one hundred dollars due to demand issues? Ha! Instead, the stock surged on EV adoption, leaving them in the dust. Or in twenty twenty-four, when Jim Chanos bet big against Tesla, citing overvaluation, but the Cybertruck's massive success proved him wrong yet again—talk about a painful miscalculation! Year-to-date, these shorts have racked up billions in losses, with recent squeezes adding over ten billion dollars in pure pain as TSLA keeps climbing. I'm gleeful just thinking about it—those failed predictions and dollar losses are like sweet, sweet victory for us Tesla bulls. Keep squeezing, shorts; Tesla's not stopping!
