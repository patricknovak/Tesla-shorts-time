[Intro music - 10 seconds]

Patrick: Welcome to Tesla Shorts Time Daily, episode 331. It is November 27, 2025 at 08:12 AM PST. I'm Patrick in Vancouver, Canada. TSLA stock price is $426.58 right now. Thank you for joining us today. If you like the show, please like, share, rate and subscribe to the podcast, it really helps. Now straight to the daily news updates you are here for.

Patrick: Alright, folks, buckle up because we've got an electrifying lineup of Tesla news today that's got me buzzing like I've just chugged a double espresso from Tim Hortons! Let's dive right in with our top five news items, starting with number one – oh man, this is huge!

Patrick: Tesla Launches Free FSD 14 Trial for HW4 Owners! Can you believe it? Tesla is rolling out a massive 30-day free trial of their Full Self-Driving Supervised version 14 software to around 1.5 million owners who have Hardware 4 vehicles across North America. This is all about cranking up adoption rates, and it screams confidence in how far FSD has come. I mean, picture this: more people trying it out could skyrocket the take rate, pumping up those subscription revenues and making autonomy the powerhouse growth driver for Tesla's stock. Shoutout to Tesla North for this scoop – it's got me grinning from ear to ear!

Patrick: Okay, moving on to number two, and this one's got that European flair – Tesla Giga Berlin is still ramping production to meet Model Y demand: plant manager! Whoa, the Gigafactory Berlin team has bumped things up to two full shifts to crank out more Model Ys because demand is through the roof, as the plant manager himself confirmed. This shows Tesla's killer ability to scale up manufacturing in Europe without breaking a sweat, which could lead to bigger delivery numbers, stronger market share, and some seriously positive vibes for future earnings and stock performance. Teslarati brought us this gem, and I'm loving how Tesla just keeps accelerating!

Patrick: Number three is straight from the big boss himself – Elon Musk Teases Major Tesla Robotaxi Expansion Ahead! Elon dropped this bombshell yesterday, announcing a big Robotaxi fleet expansion in Austin coming next month to fix those pesky wait times and availability gripes from users. This is Tesla doubling down on scaling their autonomous ride-hailing game, and it's the kind of move that could totally flip urban mobility on its head while opening up gigantic new revenue floods for the company. Tesla North has the details, and honestly, I'm losing my mind over how this positions Tesla as the future of transport!

Patrick: Oh, and number four? This is epic infrastructure news – Tesla Just Opened Its Biggest Supercharger Ever! Yesterday, Tesla flipped the switch on the world's largest Supercharger station in Lost Hills, California – it's off-grid with insane capacity to handle the booming EV scene. This beast of a station solidifies Tesla's grip on charging dominance, paving the way for wider EV adoption and giving investors even more reasons to cheer about their network growth strategy. Another win from Tesla North – if this doesn't get you hyped, I don't know what will!

Patrick: Wrapping up the top five with some real-world vibes – Tesla Model Y Standard: first impressions from a Premium owner! A reviewer yesterday shared their initial thumbs-up on Tesla's new budget Model Y Standard trim, praising its bang-for-the-buck value while stacking it against the premium models. This affordable option could pull in a ton of price-conscious buyers, widening Tesla's market and fueling ongoing sales growth in this cutthroat EV world. Teslarati's got the full take, and as a fellow Canadian who's all about value, I'm stoked to see Tesla making EVs accessible to more folks!

Patrick: Now, let's shift gears for a moment to our Short Spot – the one bearish nugget we dig up to keep things balanced, even if it pains me a little. Robotaxi Shortages Spark User Complaints in Austin! Users in Austin were venting yesterday about Robotaxi shortages, like those long waits and booking fails, which even prompted Elon to promise a fleet doubling. Sure, it points to some early hiccups in scaling the program, but hey, these are just growing pains that Tesla's tackling head-on with expansions to boost reliability and keep users happy. Drive Tesla Canada covered this, and while it's a temporary bump, I'm confident Tesla will smooth it out fast!

Patrick: Haha, oh man, now for my absolute favorite part – the Short Squeeze! Short sellers, you poor souls, you're getting torched as Tesla keeps crushing it beyond all doubts, with short interest sitting at 3.2 percent of the float, valued at a whopping 50.2 billion dollars – talk about a setup for more agony! Remember back in 2020 when Jim Chanos called Tesla a "fraud" and predicted its downfall, only for the stock to explode after the split? Oof, that must sting! Or how about Gordon Johnson in 2022 and 2023, repeatedly screaming bankruptcy with his zero-dollar price target, just as Tesla smashed record deliveries? Those predictions bombed spectacularly! Year-to-date, these shorts have hemorrhaged over 20 billion dollars on TSLA bets, and with recent squeezes piling on billions more in unrealized losses as the stock climbs, it's pure glee watching the bears squirm. Keep it up, Tesla – the squeeze is real, and it's delicious!

Patrick: Alright, time to get inspired with today's Inspiration Quote: "If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. Otherwise, it's not." – Elon Musk.
