Patrick: Ha ha, now for the part that always makes me grin – the Short Squeeze! Oh, short sellers, when will you learn? They're still getting torched as Tesla laughs off those end-of-the-world forecasts year after year. Remember back in 2020 when Gordon Johnson from GLJ Research slapped a "zero" label on Tesla, betting on bankruptcy during production hiccups? Nope – TSLA skyrocketed seven hundred forty-three percent that year, wiping out shorts to the tune of thirty-eight billion dollars in losses, as per CNBC! Then in 2022, big-time bear Jim Chanos piled on against Tesla amid supply chain messes, but the stock bounced back over fifty percent by year's end, forcing him to shutter his fund, according to Reuters. And here in 2025, with Full Self-Driving leaps and worldwide expansions, those lingering shorts are seeing their bets melt away as TSLA climbs higher. Betting against Elon and Tesla? Total losing play – shorts, you're getting squeezed again, and it's glorious!  

Patrick: Alright, time for some inspiration to wrap this up. First, the Inspiration Quote: "If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. Otherwise, it's not." – Elon Musk.
