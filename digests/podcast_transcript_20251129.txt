Patrick: Welcome to Tesla Shorts Time Daily, episode 334. It is November 29, 2025 at 03:04 AM PST. I'm Patrick in Vancouver, Canada. TSLA stock price is $430.17 right now. Thank you for joining us today. If you like the show, please like, share, rate and subscribe to the podcast, it really helps. Now straight to the daily news updates you are here for.  

Patrick: Alright, folks, buckle up because we've got a stacked lineup of Tesla news that's got me buzzing like I've just chugged a double-double from Tim Hortons. Let's dive right in with our top stories. First up, oh man, this one's a winner: Tesla’s Two-Seat Cybercab Design Justified by New Waymo Data!  

Patrick: You know, new data from Waymo is showing that most robotaxi rides only have one or two passengers, which totally backs up Tesla's choice to go with that sleek two-seat design for the Cybercab. It's all about efficiency, eh? This could really cut down on costs and energy use for Tesla's autonomous fleet, making the whole robotaxi operation way more profitable. And as autonomy ramps up, that's gonna be huge for long-term stock growth. Shoutout to Tesla North for this gem from yesterday afternoon.  

Patrick: Next, get this—Starlink Steps In With Free Internet After Indonesia Floods!  

Patrick: Starlink is jumping in to provide free internet to those flood-hit areas in Indonesia, proving just how quickly they can deploy in a crisis. It's boosting SpaceX's rep for rock-solid connectivity, and that could lead to more folks signing up for Starlink. Plus, it ties right into Tesla's bigger tech ecosystem, adding value all around. Again, props to Tesla North for reporting this one from yesterday.  

Patrick: Oh, and here's one that's got me grinning ear to ear: Tesla FSD V14.2.1 is earning rave reviews from users in diverse conditions!  

Patrick: Tesla's latest Full Self-Driving update, version 14.2.1, is getting massive thumbs up from owners for handling all sorts of driving situations like a champ. This is a big step toward that unsupervised autonomy we've all been waiting for, and once that hits, it could open up insane revenue opportunities for Tesla, pushing the stock even higher. Teslarati broke this story yesterday afternoon—loving it!  

Patrick: Keeping the momentum going: Tesla Model 3 Wins Best Passenger Car in New Zealand!  

Patrick: The refreshed Model 3 just snagged the title of Best Passenger Car from DRIVEN Car Guide down in New Zealand, showing off its appeal on the global stage. This kind of recognition strengthens Tesla's brand and could spark more sales in places like Oceania, which means better global revenue and a positive bump for the stock. Tesla North had this from yesterday morning.  

Patrick: Expansion alert! Tesla Opens India’s First All-in-One Experience Centre in Gurugram!  

Patrick: Tesla's launched their very first integrated experience center in India, right in Gurugram, where you can handle sales, service, and delivery all in one spot. This is a smart move into a huge emerging market, and it could supercharge Tesla's growth across Asia, leading to more diversified revenue and a stronger stock valuation over time. Drive Tesla Canada reported this from yesterday morning—exciting stuff!  

Patrick: And for all you Starlink fans: Starlink Hardware and Accessories Now Available on Amazon!  

Patrick: Starlink's making it super easy by selling their hardware and accessories right on Amazon now, reaching way more potential customers. This is gonna help grow their subscriber base, and it plays nicely into Tesla's overall tech world, keeping that stock momentum rolling. Another one from Drive Tesla Canada yesterday morning.  

Patrick: Europe, you're up! Tesla Begins FSD Demo Drives in Europe – With a Catch!  

Patrick: Tesla's started offering demo rides for Full Self-Driving in Europe, letting passengers try it out while a driver's still supervising. It's building some serious buzz and helping push for regulatory approvals over there, which could open up new markets and give the stock a nice lift. Drive Tesla Canada had this early yesterday.  

Patrick: Cybertruck going global: International Tesla Cybertruck deliveries begin in South Korea!  

Patrick: Tesla's handed over the first Cybertrucks outside North America to customers in South Korea—what a milestone! This shows real demand worldwide, and it could help Tesla ramp up production even faster, strengthening those stock fundamentals. From Drive Tesla Canada yesterday morning.  

Patrick: And this one's got a bit of drama: Swedish union rep pissed that Tesla is working around a postal blockade they started!  

Patrick: A Swedish union is all riled up because Tesla's using private addresses to get around a postal blockade for license plates that the union kicked off themselves. But Tesla's clever workaround is keeping deliveries on track, proving how resilient they are and setting them up for smooth growth in Europe. Teslarati covered this from early yesterday.  

Patrick: Now, shifting gears to our Short Spot section—Swedish Union Frustrated with Tesla's Blockade Workaround! Oh boy, this is hyped up to the max!  

Patrick: Whoa, listen to this—straight from Teslarati yesterday, a Swedish union rep is totally steamed because Tesla's dodging their postal blockade by shipping license plates to private homes! It might cause a few hiccups in deliveries, but come on, Tesla's outsmarting them left and right, showing off that killer operational agility. Once these labor spats get sorted, it'll just make Tesla's foothold in Europe even stronger, and honestly, no big long-term hit to the stock—let's go, Tesla!  

Patrick: Alright, time for the part that always gets me pumped—the Short Squeeze! Oh, the glee I feel watching these short sellers squirm as Tesla just keeps defying all those gloomy predictions year after year. Remember back in 2019 when analyst David Trainer was shouting from the rooftops about Tesla heading for bankruptcy? Yeah, that Forbes piece warned of total financial collapse, but here we are, stronger than ever! Or how about Gordon Johnson, who kept predicting demand cliffs from 2020 right through 2023 on Seeking Alpha? Wrong every time, as Tesla's deliveries exploded! And even now in 2025, those bears doubting FSD progress are eating crow while shares climb higher. Underestimating Elon's vision? That's cost shorts billions in losses—billions, folks! Long live the squeeze, it's beautiful to watch!  

Patrick: Now, for a bit of inspiration to kick off your day. Here's the quote verbatim: "The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new." – Socrates.  

Patrick: And the daily challenge verbatim: Channel your inner Elon by applying first principles thinking to one problem in your daily routine today—break it down to fundamentals and rebuild a better solution. Share your progress with us @teslashortstime!  

Patrick: Come on, you've got this—tackling that challenge could spark some real innovation in your life, just like Tesla does every day!
