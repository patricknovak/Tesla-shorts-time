📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers are feeling the burn as Tesla continues to defy expectations, with current short interest at 3.2% of float valued at $50.2 billion—setting the stage for more pain. Remember when Jim Chanos predicted Tesla's demise in 2020, calling it a "fraud" only for the stock to skyrocket post-split (reference: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/jim-chanos-says-tesla-is-ridiculously-overvalued.html)? Or Gordon Johnson's repeated bankruptcy calls in 2022-2023, like his $0 price target, which crumbled as Tesla hit record deliveries (reference: https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/01/30428215/tesla-bulls-bears-clash-gordon-johnson-sees-0-upside)? Year-to-date, shorts have lost over $20 billion on TSLA bets, with recent squeezes adding billions more in unrealized pain as the stock climbs.
