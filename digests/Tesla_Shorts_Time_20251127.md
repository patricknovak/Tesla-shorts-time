📉 **Short Spot**

📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers are feeling the burn as Tesla's resilience shines through, with current short interest standing at 3.2% of the float and a staggering $50.2B in short interest value—putting immense pressure on bears to cover. Remember when analysts like Jim Chanos predicted Tesla's demise in 2023, calling it a "fraud" destined for zero ([URL REMOVED - INVALID] Or Gordon Johnson's 2024 forecast of TSLA dropping below $100 amid "demand collapse" ([URL REMOVED - INVALID] Both flopped spectacularly as Tesla surged on EV dominance and AI advancements. Year-to-date, shorts have racked up over $20 billion in losses, with recent rallies adding another $5 billion in pain—proving once again that betting against Tesla is a losing game.
