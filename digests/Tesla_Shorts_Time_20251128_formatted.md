📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers are feeling the heat with Tesla's relentless momentum, as the current short interest stands at 3.2% of float valued at $50.2B, leaving bears exposed to further pain if the stock climbs. Remember the failed 2020 prediction by investor Jim Chanos, who shorted Tesla expecting bankruptcy amid production woes, only for the company to achieve profitability and a massive rally (reference: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/26/jim-chanos-converts-tesla-short-to-put-options.html). Similarly, in 2023, analyst Gordon Johnson forecasted Tesla's demise due to demand slowdowns, but record deliveries proved him wrong, squeezing shorts hard (reference: https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/01/30452215/tesla-bear-gordon-johnson-sees-ev-giant-headed-for-bankruptcy). Year-to-date, shorts have suffered estimated losses exceeding $15B as TSLA defies gravity, turning bearish bets into spectacular failures once again.
