📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers continue to feel the burn as Tesla defies pessimistic forecasts year after year, with TSLA stock surging despite repeated doomsday predictions. For instance, in 2020, analysts like those from GLJ Research predicted Tesla's collapse due to production woes, but the company achieved record deliveries instead (reference: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/02/tesla-short-sellers-lost-8-billion-in-2019-glj-researchs-gordon-johnson-lost-big.html). Fast-forward to 2023, bears bet on Cybertruck failure amid supply chain issues, yet it became a bestseller (reference: https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-short-sellers-losses-2023-1c7b2f0d); and in 2025, claims of FSD regulatory roadblocks fell flat as updates like V14.2.1 earned rave reviews, squeezing shorts further with Tesla's unbreakable innovation streak.
