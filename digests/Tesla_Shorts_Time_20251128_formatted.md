📉 **Short Spot**
One bearish item from pre-fetched (news or X post) that's negative for Tesla/stock. 
**WSJ Report Sparks Supply Chain Concerns: 27 November, 2025, 6:07 PM PST, Drive Tesla Canada** 
 A Wall Street Journal report suggested Tesla is reducing reliance on Chinese suppliers, sending shockwaves and raising fears of potential disruptions or higher costs. However, Tesla's swift pushback emphasizes stable partnerships, making this likely a temporary hiccup that's overblown by bears, as the company's agile supply chain will continue fueling growth.

📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers are feeling the burn as Tesla continues to defy gravity, with their positions underwater amid relentless innovation and market dominance. Remember when Jim Chanos famously shorted Tesla in 2020, predicting bankruptcy, only for the stock to surge over 700% that year (reference: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/jim-chanos-converts-tesla-short-to-put-options-says-stock-still-overvalued.html)? Or in 2023, when Gordon Johnson claimed Tesla's demand was collapsing and the stock would crash to $24, yet it rebounded spectacularly (reference: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567892-tesla-stock-gordon-johnson-wrong-again)? These failed bear theses highlight the perils of betting against Elon Musk's vision. Year-to-date, shorts have racked up over $20 billion in losses, with the current 3.2% short interest valued at $50.2B facing more pain from recent price gains.
