📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short sellers continue to feel the burn as Tesla defies doomsday predictions year after year. Remember when Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research called Tesla a "zero" in 2020, predicting bankruptcy amid production woes? Instead, TSLA stock exploded 743% that year, crushing shorts (reference: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/tesla-short-sellers-lost-38-billion-in-2020-as-stock-surged.html). In 2022, bears like Jim Chanos bet big against Tesla during supply chain disruptions, but the stock rebounded over 50% by year's end, leading to his fund's closure (reference: https://www.reuters.com/business/famed-short-seller-jim-chanos-shut-down-his-hedge-funds-bloomberg-news-2023-11-17/). Fast-forward to 2025, with FSD advancements and global expansions, those still shorting TSLA are watching their positions evaporate as the stock climbs—proving once again that betting against Elon and Tesla is a losing game.
