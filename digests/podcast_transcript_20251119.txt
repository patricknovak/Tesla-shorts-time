Patrick: [excited] Mission-driven, Dan—now, time for the Short Squeeze graveyard roast! Short sellers have repeatedly underestimated Tesla's resilience, leading to spectacular failures.

Market cap to trillions, autonomy and EVs dominating—his hedge fund shut down after 38 years. Bears underestimated resilience, innovation wins every time—patient believers cashing in epic gains. [excited] Shorts, stay buried!
