Now straight to the daily news updates you are here for.  
Patrick: Number one: Musk Taps Tesla Fleet Data for AGI Breakthrough!  
Elon Musk revealed late last night on November 24th at six thirteen PM Pacific that the vast real-world data pouring in from Tesla's massive vehicle fleet combined with X's live feeds is absolutely supercharging xAI's sprint straight to artificial general intelligence—AGI.  
This unique dataset? It's giving Tesla and xAI an unbeatable edge over every rival out there scrambling without this insane scale of real-world inputs.  
Tesla sitting right at the dead center of the AI revolution? That amps its valuation way beyond just autos into multi-trillion-dollar robotaxi fleets and humanoid robot markets—super bullish for TSLA shares exploding higher, no question.  
Decrypt broke this wide open.  
Patrick: Number two: Tesla's FSD Gains Traction Push in Europe!  
Elon Musk on November 24th at six oh three PM Pacific directed Tesla's super loyal followers to flood the Dutch transit authority with massive support for rolling out Full Self-Driving across all of Europe.  
Boom—the authority fired back with a formal response, pushing the whole regulatory dialogue forward in a big way.  
This grassroots momentum? It screams Tesla's unmatched community power, accelerating unsupervised FSD rollout right across the continent and unlocking those massive robotaxi revenue streams that will send the stock absolutely exploding.  
TheStreet is all over this one.  
Patrick: Number three: DOJ Scrambles to Block Musk in USAID Shakeup Lawsuit!  
On November 24th at four forty-nine PM Pacific, the Department of Justice scrambled hard to block Elon Musk's own deposition in this lawsuit challenging the USAID shutdown that he straight-up championed through those DOGE cuts.  
This total resistance? It just underscores Musk's raw disruptive force ripping through government bloat like nobody's business.  
Efficient policy under Musk's heavy influence redirects trillions of dollars straight to innovation hubs like Tesla, fueling explosive EV scaling, total energy storage dominance, and straight-up AI leadership for those sustained TSLA gains that keep piling on.  
Forbes nailed the details here.  
Patrick: Number four: US Markets Launch DOGE ETF in Crypto Milestone!  
American exchanges dropped a DOGE ETF on November 24th at eight PM Pacific—hailed as crypto's most surreal mainstream breakthrough ever, all fueled by that wild internet-driven demand.  
With Musk's longstanding Dogecoin fandom front and center, this validates the full meme-to-mainstream momentum like nothing else.  
It bolsters the entire crypto ecosystem where Tesla holds those key strategic assets, cranks up the hype around all Musk's ventures, and delivers those speculative tailwinds lifting TSLA shares even higher.  
AMBCrypto called it perfectly.  
Patrick: Number five: Automakers Dodge Tesla's FSD Licensing Offer!  
Elon Musk confirmed on November 24th at six forty-eight PM Pacific that after years of pitching, other carmakers have zero interest in licensing Tesla's advanced Full Self-Driving tech.  
He put it bluntly: they don’t want it!  
That highlights how rivals just can't match Tesla's autonomous prowess right now.  
This total validation of Tesla's solo path to supremacy in self-driving fortifies its massive tech moat as FSD keeps dazzling owners with improvements and propels the stock way higher.  
Electrek reported it straight.  
Patrick: And here's the Short Spot: Automakers Reject FSD Licensing Dream!  
Elon Musk bluntly admitted on November 24th at six forty-eight PM Pacific that no other automakers want to license Tesla's FSD software—dashing those hopes for quick licensing revenue streams outside Tesla's own vehicles.  
This could be a potential drag on near-term software monetization narratives that some bulls love to hype, handing shorts a bit of brief ammunition right in the middle of this FSD ramp-up.  
Electrek with the article again on this one.  
Patrick: And now, it’s time for everyone’s favourite segment—the Short Squeeze!  
Tesla shorts are melting down hard as TSLA blasts to four hundred nineteen dollars and forty cents, obliterating their bags at every single goddamn turn—ha ha!  
Current short interest? Hovering at two point seven percent of float, that's about six point eight billion dollars exposed, straight from those recent Nasdaq filings.  
Bears getting stung bad: Ross Gerber's mid-two thousand twenty-five call for TSLA tanking under two hundred dollars? Looks utterly laughable right now, completely torched.  
Meanwhile, those two thousand twenty-four predictions from Kerrisdale Capital screaming bankruptcy vibes? Vaporized into thin air thanks to the relentless robotaxi surge.  
Year-to-date two thousand twenty-five, shorts have coughed up over sixteen billion dollars in this non-stop squeeze, all powered by those killer FSD milestones and straight AI firepower—shorts just can't stop the bleed, eh?  
Patrick: Today’s inspirational quote comes straight from the digest: “Tesla’s fleet and X’s live data are providing [me] with training inputs that competitors lack.” — Elon Musk.
