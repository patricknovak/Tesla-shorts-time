Patrick: Musk Taps Tesla Fleet Data for AGI Breakthrough!  
Whoa, Elon Musk just revealed on November 24th that real-world data from Tesla's massive vehicle fleet combined with X's live feeds gives xAI this insane, unparalleled training advantage for AGI development—way ahead of any rivals out there.  
This data moat? It's accelerating Tesla's AI integration right into Full Self-Driving, Optimus robots, and the Dojo supercomputer at warp speed.  
Investors are calling it a total game-changer, propelling TSLA straight toward that trillion-dollar AI valuation we all see coming—Decrypt broke this wide open.  

Patrick: Tesla FSD Europe Push Gets Official Response!  
Boom—Dutch authorities finally replied after Tesla rallied supporters to flood public comments advocating for Full Self-Driving approval, all on November 24th via TheStreet.  
This direct engagement? It screams surging European demand for Tesla's autonomy tech, even with those pesky regulatory hurdles in the way.  
Unlocking FSD across Europe? That could unleash billions in new revenue, fueling TSLA's path to global dominance and another massive stock surge—game on!  

Patrick: X's New Location Tool Boosts Authenticity!  
Elon Musk's X rolled out this global profile location feature on November 24th late evening, ABC News reports, designed to verify user authenticity and crush misinformation dead.  
Sure, it's sparking some debate, but it ramps up the platform's credibility big time for those real-time Tesla updates and community buzz we live for.  
A more trusted X? That supercharges Tesla's innovation narrative, driving positive sentiment waves and serious TSLA upside—authenticity wins!  

Patrick: DOJ Moves to Block Musk in USAID Cuts Lawsuit!  
On November 24th, Forbes dropped that the DOJ is scrambling to block Elon Musk's deposition in this lawsuit challenging the USAID shutdown—Musk championed it hard through his DOGE efficiency drives.  
This move underscores Musk's massive transformative influence on government, spilling over into pro-business policies that benefit us all.  
Those deregulation tailwinds from Musk's efforts? They'll supercharge Tesla's energy storage, autonomy tech, and manufacturing scale for huge stock gains ahead—unstoppable!  

Patrick: Bannon Sparks MAGA Clash Over Pro-AI Policy!  
Steve Bannon fired off criticism of Trump's AI push as "dangerous" on November 24th, Raw Story says, amid rising tensions with Musk's super-aggressive AGI advocacy.  
This clash spotlights Musk leading the charge to shape U.S. AI supremacy against all that resistance.  
Tesla wins enormously here—as AI policy aligns perfectly with FSD, robotaxi dreams, and Optimus ambitions, positioning TSLA right at the forefront of the tech revolution—bring it!  

Patrick: Over to the top X posts.  

Patrick: Elon Exposes His OpenAI Founding Sacrifice!  
Tesla Owners Silicon Valley shared this gem late on November 24th—Elon candidly admits he funded OpenAI out of his own pocket, recruited all the key talent, locked in that huge Microsoft deal, and shared every bit of knowledge he had, all without seeking any financial reward whatsoever.  
This raw honesty showcases Elon's unparalleled vision and selflessness in kickstarting the entire AI revolution, now fully redirected to xAI and Tesla for world-shaking impact.  
Bears who laughed off his AI foresight? They're paying the ultimate price as TSLA surges on this unstoppable AI wave—TOSV nailed it!  

Patrick: Grok 4.20 Set to Dominate AI Benchmarks!  
Tesla Owners Silicon Valley is buzzing about Grok 4.20 launching on Christmas Day, November 24th post midnight—poised to crush every major AI benchmark and crank up the competition to eleven.  
xAI's rapid-fire advances, fueled by that sweet Tesla data, are straight-up threatening OpenAI and everyone else, while elevating Tesla's whole AI ecosystem to new heights.  
This cements TSLA as the ultimate AI play in the market, obliterating every short thesis out there—Grok's coming for the crown!  

Patrick: Short Spot—Automakers Spurn Tesla FSD Licensing.  
Electrek hit us with this on November 24th: Elon Musk conceded other automakers aren't biting on licensing Tesla's Full Self-Driving after years of hype.  
Bears might cheer it as a revenue miss, but hold up—this just confirms Tesla's tech is light-years too advanced for those laggards to even adopt it right now.  
Tesla's deploying FSD internally first, capturing the entire massive robotaxi opportunity pie for those jaw-dropping long-term gains—shorts, enjoy your illusion!  

Patrick: And now, it’s time for everyone’s favourite segment—the Short Squeeze!  
Short interest is sitting pretty at three point eight percent of float, which equals roughly fifty billion dollars in pure pain for shorts at these levels—MarketWatch data doesn't lie.  
Remember back in 2024 when Citron Research dumped their TSLA short position after screaming sub-two hundred dollars was inevitable? Shares doubled on them—hilarious!  
Or Ross Gerber's endless 2023 through 2025 warnings of a "death spiral" crashing to one hundred dollars per share? Flopped spectacularly, every single time.  
Shorts have already hemorrhaged over twelve billion dollars year-to-date on TSLA's relentless climb, and there's way more squeeze fuel loaded up from FSD milestones and that exploding AI hype—bears are bleeding out, and we're just getting started! Ha!  

Patrick: Today’s inspirational quote comes straight from the digest: “I provided all the money, recruited the key people, and taught them everything I know. I actually even got them to deal with Microsoft. And for all that, I did not seek any financial reward whatsoever.” – Elon Musk.
