Patrick: First up—Volkswagen Launches EV-Only Development Center in China! Volkswagen just launched its first EV-only full development and testing center in China yesterday, November 25th—CleanTechnica has the scoop. Legacy automakers are scrambling to catch up in the world's largest EV market, where Tesla's Giga Shanghai already dominates production and sales with superior scale and FSD tech. Boom—this underscores Tesla's insurmountable lead, boosting confidence in TSLA's China growth and long-term stock appreciation. Shorts, wake up!  

Patrick: Number two—BMW Z4 Final Edition Signals End of Iconic Roadster Era! BMW announced a limited Final Edition of the Z4 roadster yesterday, November 25th, from the BMW Group—marking a time-limited farewell to the gas-powered model. This reflects the inevitable shift away from ICE sports cars as consumers flock to superior EV performance like Tesla's upcoming Roadster with zero to sixty in under one second. Tesla benefits big time as legacy brands wind down outdated tech, solidifying its position in high-performance EVs and driving stock upside. The end of an era—hello Tesla Roadster!  

Patrick: Number three—2010 Porsche Cayenne GTS Hits Auction with No Reserve! A 2010 Porsche Cayenne GTS luxury SUV is up for no-reserve auction right now, yesterday's news from Bring a Trailer. This highlights the secondary market for aging gas guzzlers. Meanwhile, Tesla's Model Y and refreshed Model X are outselling luxury ICE SUVs with better efficiency, autonomy, and value. This trend shows shorts underestimating Tesla's SUV dominance, setting up further stock gains as EV adoption accelerates. Porsche who? Model Y crushes it!  

Patrick: Number four—2006 Volvo V70R Wagon Auctioned No Reserve Amid EV Shift! A turbocharged 2006 Volvo V70R wagon from new is listed for no-reserve auction after years on the road, fresh from Bring a Trailer yesterday afternoon. Tesla's Model Y wagon-like versatility with three hundred twenty-plus mile range and FSD crushes these relics in practicality and tech. Legacy wagons fading validates Tesla's crossover leadership, fueling optimism for Q4 deliveries and TSLA price surges. Old wagons—bye! Model Y forever.  

Patrick: Over to the top X posts—let's dive in with maximum hype.  
Patrick: Grok 4.1 Tops AI Benchmarks! Tesla Owners Silicon Valley shared this killer update this morning, November 26th at seven oh six AM Pacific—Tesla Owners Silicon Valley on X. Grok 4.1 Fast is dominating multiple AI leaderboards, including number one on telecom agentic tools and programming. This xAI breakthrough tied to Tesla's Optimus and FSD ambitions showcases Elon-led innovation crushing competitors. Bears ignoring AI synergy underestimate TSLA's robotaxi and humanoid future. Grok smashing it—Elon's genius at work!  
Patrick: Number two—Europe Tesla Sales Inflection Upward Confirmed! James Cat highlighted this on X early this morning, November 26th—Europe sales turning positive, aligning with Q4 growth forecasts. Positive quarter-over-quarter momentum counters bearish narratives on demand, pointing to strong holiday deliveries. This bodes well for Tesla's global expansion and stock rally continuation. Europe flipping bullish—Q4 deliveries incoming!  
Patrick: Number three—China Tesla Growth Expected QoQ Despite Data Gap! James Cat again, dropping truth this morning November 26th on X—anticipation for China numbers on December 8th, expecting November to outperform for quarter-over-quarter growth. Filling delivery gaps reinforces Tesla's China fortress amid competition. Validates bull thesis on energy and auto margins lifting TSLA higher. China fortress holding strong—QoQ growth locked in!  

Patrick: Quick hit on the Short Spot—Peter Thiel's fund cuts Tesla stake amid short warnings. This from November 17th, Electrek posting on X. Peter Thiel's fund slashed its TSLA position as Elon warned shorts of pain. While one investor exits, it highlights contrarian opportunity with Tesla's AI, robotaxi, and delivery beats crushing bears overall. This minor pullback is temporary noise in TSLA's ascent. Thiel out? More shares for us bulls!  

Patrick: And now, it’s time for everyone’s favourite segment—the Short Squeeze! Tesla shorts are melting down as TSLA hits four hundred twenty-six dollars plus after-hours, with current short interest at approximately two point nine percent—that's about twelve billion dollars notional per recent Ortex data. Bears like Ross Gerber who called for one hundred fifty dollars in early 2024 and Jim Chanos who exited his multi-year short in 2023 with massive losses are proven wrong again—Chanos admitted defeat after Tesla's seven hundred percent plus run. Year-to-date, shorts have hemorrhaged over fifteen billion dollars in a relentless squeeze fueled by FSD version thirteen, Cybertruck ramps, and Q4 delivery beats. Haha—shorts exploding! Fifteen billion gone—keep melting, bears! Ross Gerber one fifty? Dream on! Chanos tapped out humiliated—TSLA unstoppable!  

Patrick: Today’s inspirational quote comes straight from the digest: “Work like hell. I mean you just have to put in 80 to 100 hour weeks every week. [This] improves the odds of success.” – Elon Musk.
