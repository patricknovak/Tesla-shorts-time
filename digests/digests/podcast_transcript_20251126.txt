Patrick: X Launches Global Location Tool to Verify Profiles!  
Social media platform X rolled out a new location verification tool worldwide over the weekend to boost profile authenticity—huge move on November 24th at 8:50 PM Pacific. While some experts question user trust and misinformation risks, this innovation under Elon Musk strengthens X's credibility and data ecosystem. And get this—it directly fuels Tesla's AI advantages via real-world inputs. Positions Musk's empire for explosive growth. Lifting TSLA long-term. ABC News has the details.  
Patrick: Musk Admits Automakers Reject Tesla FSD License!  
Elon Musk confirmed that other automakers have no interest in licensing Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology after years of speculation—reported November 24th at 6:48 PM Pacific by Electrek. Far from a loss. This validates Tesla's unmatched lead in autonomy. Preserves its tech moat. Enables exclusive monetization through robotaxis and subscriptions. Competitors' fear signals TSLA's path to trillion-dollar valuations. Boom!  
Patrick: Musk Harnesses Tesla & X Data for AGI Breakthrough!  
Elon Musk explained how Tesla's vehicle fleet and X's live user data provide unique real-world training for xAI's AGI pursuits—Decrypt dropped this November 24th at 6:13 PM Pacific. Outpacing rivals completely. This synergy cements Tesla as the backbone of next-gen AI. Unlocking Optimus robots. Unsupervised FSD. Multi-trillion market caps. Investors rejoicing at this unfair advantage. Insane!  
Patrick: Tesla Receives Key Response on FSD Rollout in Europe!  
Tesla garnered a significant reply from Dutch regulators after Elon Musk urged supporters to lobby for Full Self-Driving approval—November 24th at 6:03 PM Pacific via TheStreet. This breakthrough advances FSD deployment across Europe. Critical for scaling robotaxi networks. Global dominance incoming. Turbocharges TSLA's autonomy narrative and stock momentum. Yes!  
Patrick: DOJ Seeks to Block Musk Deposition Over USAID Shutdown!  
The Department of Justice is moving to prevent Elon Musk from being deposed in a lawsuit targeting his role in dismantling USAID—Forbes reported this November 24th at 4:49 PM Pacific. Musk's bold government reforms showcase his efficiency prowess. A temporary sideshow that underscores his influence. Meanwhile, Tesla crushes execution on EVs, energy, and AI. TSLA thrives amid the chaos. Unstoppable.  
Patrick: DOJ Scrambles to Block Musk Testimony!  
The DOJ is fighting to avoid Elon Musk's deposition in a lawsuit stemming from his push to shutter USAID—another angle from Forbes on November 24th at 4:49 PM Pacific. Highlights potential legal entanglements from his government efficiency role. Could divert Musk's focus amid DOGE challenges. Creating short-term uncertainty for Tesla leadership bandwidth and stock stability. Bears may cling to this as a distraction risk. But hey, we know Tesla keeps winning.  
Patrick: And now, it’s time for everyone’s favourite segment — the Short Squeeze!  
Short interest lingers at a pitiful two point nine percent of float, amounting to twelve point one billion dollars in exposed agony—per latest Ortex data. A fraction of TSLA's blistering ascent! Recall Jim Chanos folding his massive TSLA short in early 2024 after forecasting sub-one hundred dollar shares—only to watch it rocket past four hundred dollars. Or Ross Gerber's mid-2025 doom call for a two hundred dollar collapse amid "demand apocalypse"—obliterated by record deliveries! Year to date, shorts have hemorrhaged over eighteen billion dollars. With every squeeze event amplifying the carnage. Tesla's relentless climb leaves them buried! Laugh all the way to the bank, folks—the bears are toast.  
Patrick: Today’s inspirational quote comes straight from the digest: “Tesla’s fleet and X’s live data are providing him with training inputs that competitors lack.” — Elon Musk.
