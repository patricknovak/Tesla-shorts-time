Now straight to the daily news updates you are here for.  
Patrick: Number one: Tesla Hypes FSD Europe Approval, Regulator Clarifies No Decision Yet—from Business Insider yesterday at 8:23 AM Pacific.  
Tesla just celebrated this anticipated full self-driving approval coming from the Dutch regulator RDW back in February 2026. But hold on—the agency clarified no final decision has been made yet. This really underscores the ongoing regulatory navigation Tesla's powering through, and it's totally temporary because their superior FSD safety data shines globally. Unlocking Europe? That accelerates autonomy subscriptions big time and unlocks massive robotaxi potential—supercharging TSLA growth like you wouldn't believe.  
Patrick: Number two: Elon's xAI Nears $15 Billion Funding Close in December—from CNBC yesterday at 7:49 AM Pacific.  
Elon Musk's xAI is on track to finalize a massive fifteen billion dollar funding round next month amid this surging AI demand exploding everywhere. This huge capital infusion strengthens xAI's competition head-on with OpenAI. And get this—there are clear synergies boosting Tesla's own AI efforts in FSD and Optimus. It all reinforces Elon's leadership in AI, driving Tesla's tech edge higher and higher, with massive stock upside screaming ahead.  
Patrick: Number three: Sergey Brin Rockets to 3rd Richest at $248 Billion, Still Behind Elon Musk—from Livemint yesterday at 7:52 AM Pacific.  
Google co-founder Sergey Brin's net worth has surged to two hundred forty-eight point four billion dollars, rocketing him to the world's third richest spot. Larry Page grabs second—but both still trail Elon Musk. This snapshot celebrates Elon's enduring lead in wealth, all powered by Tesla's absolute dominance shaking markets. It validates Tesla's transformative impact, fueling investor confidence like a rocket launch.  
Patrick: Number four: DOGE Lives On Despite Media Claims of Demise—from The Daily Caller yesterday at 7:08 AM Pacific.  
Reports claiming the Department of Government Efficiency—or DOGE—is being disbanded? Totally debunked by administration officials—they confirm it's still fully operational. Elon Musk's efficiency push endures strong. This fosters pro-innovation policies that straight-up benefit Tesla's energy and autonomy ambitions. It enhances Elon's policy influence, creating long-term tailwinds for TSLA that just keep building.  
Patrick: Over to the top X posts now—let's dive in.  
Patrick: First one: Europe Tesla Sales Turning the Corner—from this morning at 4:30 AM Pacific.  
Analyst TSLAFanMtl is highlighting how Tesla's Europe sales are inflecting upward right now. He's predicting solid Q4 results and real quarter-over-quarter growth based on those early forecasts. This counters all the bearish delivery fears head-on, signaling a demand rebound that's key for margins and global scaling. It bolsters confidence big time in TSLA hitting those aggressive targets—game on!  
Patrick: Number two: Robotaxi Haters Keep Moving Goalposts—from this morning at 7:27 AM Pacific.  
WholeMarsBlog is straight-up mocking the skeptics shifting their arguments—from no self-driving, to no launch, to now no scale on Tesla Robotaxi. It's just like what doubters said about Waymo back in the day. This captures the unstoppable momentum as Tesla proves the visionaries right every step. Critical for framing FSD as that inevitable trillion-dollar opportunity—absolutely crushing the shorts.  
Patrick: Now the Short Spot for the bears: FSD Europe Hopes Dashed by Regulator Clarification—from Business Insider yesterday at 8:23 AM Pacific.  
The Dutch RDW regulator refuted Tesla's claim of a committed FSD approval in February 2026—they're stating no decision exists yet. This delays the potential Europe rollout, which is a key growth market for that sweet autonomy revenue. Bears might hype it as a setback—but Tesla's data dominance will prevail, no question.  
Patrick: And now, it’s time for everyone’s favourite segment—the Short Squeeze!  
Short interest is hovering at a measly two point nine percent of float—that's about thirty-eight billion dollars at current prices—leaving those bears so exposed as TSLA just grinds relentlessly higher, per the latest market data. Remember GLJ Research's Gordon Johnson forecasting a twenty-three dollar price target way back in early 2023? Ha—way off, as shares have eighteen-x'd since then! Or Ross Gerber's 2024 calls for sub-one hundred fifty dollars amid his so-called demand collapse? Obliterated now at four twenty! Shorts have hemorrhaged over twelve billion dollars just year-to-date in 2025 alone in this relentless squeeze—and oh man, there's more pain coming as deliveries and FSD ignite everything. Laugh all the way to the bank, folks—the bears are toast!  
Patrick: Today’s inspirational quote comes straight from the digest: “Tech billionaires 'are really betting on AI replacing a lot of workers.'” – Godfather of AI.
