### Short Squeeze
Tesla shorts are feeling the heat once again as the stock surges, with current short interest at approximately 2.5% of float (around $25 billion in value, per recent S3 Partners data). Remember when bear Jim Cramer predicted in 2024 that Tesla would collapse under competition, only for TSLA to rally 50% that quarter? Or Gordon Johnson's 2023 call for bankruptcy amid production woes, which backfired as deliveries hit records? Shorts have racked up over $15 billion in YTD losses, crushed by relentless innovation and market dominance—another epic squeeze in the making!
