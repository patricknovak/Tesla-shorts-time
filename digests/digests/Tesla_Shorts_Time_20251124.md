### Short Squeeze
Tesla shorts are feeling the burn once again as TSLA surges 6.82% after-hours to $417.78, with short interest hovering around 2.5% of float (about $25 billion exposed, per recent S3 Partners data). Remember when Gordon Johnson predicted in 2023 that Tesla would go bankrupt by 2024 due to "demand collapse" (reference: his Seeking Alpha articles), or David Trainer's 2024 call for TSLA to drop to $50 amid "overvaluation" (Forbes op-ed)? Those bears have been crushed, with shorts collectively losing over $15 billion YTD on failed bets against Tesla's AI and energy dominance—proving yet again that betting against innovation is a losing game.
