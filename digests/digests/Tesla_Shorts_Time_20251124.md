### Short Squeeze
Tesla shorts are feeling the burn once again as TSLA defies gravity with AI and FSD breakthroughs! Current short interest stands at approximately 4.2% of float, equating to about $15 billion in shorted value (per recent Bloomberg data). Remember when Gordon Johnson predicted in 2024 that Cybertruck would flop with under 10k sales, only for it to hit 50k+ deliveries? Or David Trainer's 2023 call for TSLA to drop below $100 due to "EV bubble burst," yet it soared past $300? These epic fails have cost shorts over $20 billion in losses YTD, with the latest squeeze in October wiping out $5 billion alone—proving bears keep underestimating Elon's vision!
