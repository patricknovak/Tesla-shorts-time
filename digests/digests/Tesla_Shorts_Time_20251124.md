### Short Squeeze
Tesla shorts are feeling the burn once again as TSLA surges, with current short interest at approximately 2.8% of float (about 90 million shares, valued at roughly $37 billion based on recent data from Bloomberg). Remember when bear Gordon Johnson predicted in 2024 that Tesla would go bankrupt by 2025 due to demand collapse (reference: his infamous CNBC appearance), or David Trainer's 2023 call for TSLA to drop to $50 amid overvaluation (via Seeking Alpha)? Both flopped spectacularly as Tesla's deliveries soared; shorts have racked up over $15 billion in losses YTD alone from repeated squeezes, proving the power of innovation over doubt.
