Patrick: And now, it’s time for everyone’s favourite segment — the Short Squeeze!  
Patrick: Tesla shorts are feeling the burn once again as TSLA defies all those bearish bets with relentless innovation — ha, current short interest stands at around two point five percent of float, equating to over twenty billion dollars in shorted value, per recent Bloomberg data.  
Patrick: Remember when analyst Gary Black predicted in twenty twenty-four that Robotaxi delays would tank TSLA below two hundred dollars — yet here we are above three hundred ninety after all these autonomy wins? Oh man, that was so wrong!  
Patrick: Or Ross Gerber's twenty twenty-three call for Elon to step down, which totally backfired as Tesla's market cap soared past one trillion dollars? Shorts have racked up over fifteen billion dollars in losses year-to-date, and with the latest FSD and Optimus news poised to squeeze them even harder — it's proving that bears underestimate Tesla's resilience every single time, and I can't help but laugh at how they're getting crushed!
