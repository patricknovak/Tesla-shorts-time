Patrick: Tesla Reduces Sentry Mode Power Usage for Cybertruck! Tesla has rolled out an update in software version 2024.38 that's slashing power usage for Sentry Mode by up to forty percent on the Cybertruck, directly tackling those battery drain complaints from owners when the truck's parked for long stretches. This is a game-changer for efficiency. It ramps up the Cybertruck's appeal for everyday scenarios like airport parking or overnight stays, and who knows, this could ripple out to better energy management across all Tesla models as autonomy ramps up—think higher customer satisfaction, stronger brand loyalty, and yes, that sweet boost to stock value. Not A Tesla App broke this one.  
Patrick: Elon Musk Envisions AI Making Work Optional! Elon Musk is out here dropping bombshells, predicting that AI and robotics—like Tesla's own Optimus—could turn work into something totally optional, with money becoming irrelevant in just ten to twenty years, where jobs are more like hobbies you choose. Wow. This vision cements Tesla's frontrunner status in AI tech, from Full Self-Driving to Robotaxi fleets, setting the stage for explosive growth in autonomous economies that have investors buzzing with long-term optimism for TSLA shares.

Patrick: Cybertruck Owners Report Buyer's Remorse! A Newsweek article is spotlighting some Cybertruck owners feeling regret over their buys, tying it to Elon Musk's public image, and claiming Tesla isn't taking returns. It's a potential ding on brand perception for sure. But hey, Tesla's powerhouse innovation—like Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi—is geared to eclipse this short-term noise and propel stock recovery.

Patrick: And now, it’s time for everyone’s favourite segment — the Short Squeeze! Oh man, Tesla shorts are getting torched yet again with TSLA rocketing six point eight two percent after-hours to four hundred seventeen dollars and seventy-eight cents, and short interest at about two point five percent of the float—that's roughly twenty-five billion dollars exposed, according to recent S three Partners data. Ha! Remember back in 2023 when Gordon Johnson was boldly predicting on Seeking Alpha that Tesla would go bankrupt by 2024 because of some so-called demand collapse? Or how about David Trainer in 2024, calling for TSLA to plummet to fifty bucks in a Forbes op-ed, screaming overvaluation? Those bears have been absolutely demolished, with shorts racking up collective losses over fifteen billion dollars year-to-date on their disastrous bets against Tesla's AI and energy supremacy—proves once more that wagering against true innovation is a one-way ticket to pain!
