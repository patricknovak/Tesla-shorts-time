📈 **Short Squeeze**
Tesla shorts are melting down as TSLA hits $422, with short interest hovering around 2.8% (~75 million shares, $31B+ pain at current prices per Nasdaq data).

YTD, shorts have hemorrhaged over $12B in mark-to-market losses amid relentless EV/AI surges—keep covering, the squeeze intensifies!
