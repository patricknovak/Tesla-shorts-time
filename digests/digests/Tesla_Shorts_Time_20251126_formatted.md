📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short interest hovers at a measly 2.9% of float (~$38 billion at current prices), leaving bears exposed as TSLA grinds higher—per recent market data. Remember GLJ Research's Gordon Johnson forecasting $23 PT in early 2023 (way off as shares 18x'd), or Ross Gerber's 2024 calls for sub-$150 amid "demand collapse" now obliterated at $420. Shorts hemorrhaged over $12 billion YTD 2025 alone in this relentless squeeze, with more pain ahead as deliveries and FSD ignite!
