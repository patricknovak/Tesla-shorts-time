📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short interest hovers around 2.8% of float, equating to roughly $33 billion in pain at TSLA's $1.2 trillion market cap (per recent Nasdaq data). Bears like Jim Cramer who called TSLA a "sell" in 2023 and Ross Gerber's dire $TSLA predictions throughout 2024-2025 have been spectacularly wrong as shares surged over 100% YTD. Shorts have hemorrhaged more than $20 billion YTD, with every Robotaxi update twisting the knife deeper—Tesla's unstoppable!
