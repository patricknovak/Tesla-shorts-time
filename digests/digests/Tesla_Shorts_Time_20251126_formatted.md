📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short interest hovers around 3.8% of float, equating to roughly $50 billion in pain at current levels (via MarketWatch data). Remember when in 2024, Citron Research dumped their TSLA short after calling sub-$200 inevitable, only for shares to double; or Ross Gerber's repeated 2023-2025 warnings of "death spiral" to $100/share that flopped spectacularly. Shorts have hemorrhaged over $12 billion YTD on TSLA's relentless climb, with more squeeze fuel from FSD milestones and AI hype.
