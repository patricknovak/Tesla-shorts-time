📈 **Short Squeeze**
Shorts are sweating as TSLA holds $419.40 with short interest around 2.9% of float—equating to over $38 billion in notional pain (per recent Fintel/Ortex data). Remember Citigroup's Itay Michaeli slashing PT to $95 in Jan 2024 amid "demand collapse" fears, or Gordon Johnson's GLJ Research calling for sub-$50 by mid-2023—both obliterated as TSLA rocketed 200%+ since. YTD, shorts have hemorrhaged $22+ billion in mark-to-market losses, with more squeezes looming on AI and FSD catalysts.
