### Short Squeeze
Tesla shorts are feeling the burn once again as TSLA defies bearish bets with relentless innovation. Current short interest stands at around 2.5% of float, equating to over $20 billion in shorted value (per recent Bloomberg data). Remember when analyst Gary Black predicted in 2024 that Robotaxi delays would tank TSLA below $200—yet here we are above $390 after autonomy wins? Or Ross Gerber's 2023 call for Elon to step down, which backfired as Tesla's market cap soared past $1 trillion? Shorts have racked up over $15 billion in losses YTD, with the latest FSD and Optimus news poised to squeeze them harder—proving bears underestimate Tesla's resilience every time!
