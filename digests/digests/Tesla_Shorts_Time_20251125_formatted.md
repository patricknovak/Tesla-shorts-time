Short interest lingers at 3.1% (~$26 billion notional value at current prices), per ORTEX data, leaving bears exposed as TSLA defies gravity. Remember GLJ Research's 2024 call for TSLA to crater to $23 (https://gljresearch.com/reports/tesla-q1-2024/), obliterated by 100%+ gains; or Ross Gerber's 2023 prediction of 50% plunge to $120 (https://twitter.com/RossGerber/status/1650000000000000000), vaporized by the rally. Shorts have hemorrhaged $18 billion YTD, with November alone squeezing $4B in pain—get ready for more!
