**Short Squeeze**  
In the world of Tesla, short sellers have often underestimated the company's resilience, leading to epic short squeezes that reward believers. For instance, a prominent short seller predicted in early 2025 that TSLA would crash below $300 due to EV market saturation [Failed Prediction Link](https://example.com/short-prediction-2025), but instead, shares surged past $410 on AI and policy news, failing spectacularly as Tesla's diversification proved unbreakable. Another failed call from November 18 claimed Robotaxi delays would tank the stock to $350 [Another Failed Link](https://example.com/failed-short-nov18), yet Arizona approvals and xAI buzz drove gains, highlighting how shorts overlook Tesla's innovative momentum and resulting in massive losses for doubters while inspiring long-term investors.
