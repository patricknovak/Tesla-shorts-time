# Tesla Shorts Time – The Pod | Ep 324 | November 20, 2025

[Intro music fades in – 8 seconds]

Patrick: Welcome to Tesla Shorts Time – The Pod, episode 324 — it's November 20, 2025 and I'm Patrick in Vancouver with my good friend and fellow Tesla enthusiast Dan in Ontario. TSLA stock is currently at $395.23 -8.76 (-2.17%) (After-hours). 

Patrick: Sentiment score today is 72 out of 100 — things are looking positive for Tesla. Dan, what’s your take?

Dan: Oh man, Patrick, that 72 out of 100 is spot on with the blend we're seeing – optimism from all the AI funding buzz and policy support, but tempered by those executive pay concerns and Robotaxi delays. Still, Tesla's innovative strides are dominating, and we've got upward stock momentum in the reports. Based on the recent buzz around xAI funding and analyst endorsements of FSD advancements, I predict today's closing price will rebound to around $405, reflecting that resilience amid market fluctuations. Tesla's just too tough to keep down, eh?

Patrick: Totally agree, Dan – that rebound prediction has me fired up! Let's dive right into the top news items from the last 24 hours. Starting with this one from Reuters: "Forget Musk's latest pay package, his last one could wipe out years of Tesla profits." So, Tesla's 2018 compensation package for Elon Musk is still in legal battles, and if approved, it could significantly impact future profits. Highlights those governance challenges, but man, it underscores Musk's pivotal role in driving innovation. High stakes for visionary leadership, yet Tesla's track record shows these hurdles often fuel greater achievements in EV and AI tech.

Dan: Yeah, Patrick, it's a reminder of the drama, but Tesla thrives on it. Next up, from Yahoo Finance: "Tesla Stock Climbs on Buzz of a Huge $15 Billion xAI Fundraise." TSLA shares rose amid reports of Elon Musk's xAI seeking that massive $15 billion funding round, boosting investor confidence in those interconnected ventures. The news propelled stock gains, more than doubling xAI's valuation to $230 billion. This synergy between Tesla and xAI is signaling explosive growth in AI, and it's got me believing in Musk's ecosystem to revolutionize transportation and tech for a brighter future. [excited]

Patrick: Explosive is right – that cross-pollination is gold! And check this from Stocktwits: "Tesla Stock Rises After-Hours As Trump Says His Tax Bill Makes Made-In-America Cars Affordable." President Trump's proposed tax package, with those loan-interest deductions, is set to enhance affordability of U.S.-made vehicles, lifting TSLA after-hours. Trump even directly praised Elon Musk, emphasizing benefits for Tesla's domestic production. Policy tailwinds like this could accelerate EV adoption, empowering Tesla to lead a sustainable automotive revolution and create jobs nationwide.

Dan: Loving that Trump shoutout – it's like rocket fuel for Tesla! But then there's this dip noted in Invezz: "Tesla stock tumbles over 3% on Tuesday: are Robotaxi dreams fading fast?" TSLA dropped over 3% amid doubts on Robotaxi timelines due to regulatory hurdles and competition, challenging the autonomy strategy. Despite the dip, analysts are pointing to Tesla's strong foundation in AI. These setbacks highlight innovation risks, but they showcase Tesla's ability to pivot and emerge stronger – challenges as stepping stones to autonomous breakthroughs, you know?

Patrick: Pivoting like pros, that's Tesla. And bouncing back strong in this from Rolling Out: "Tesla stock surges 5% after xAI's massive funding news." Shares climbed to $410.50 following xAI's $15 billion funding announcement, surging 5% and elevating its valuation. This excites investors about AI integrations in Tesla's ecosystem, demonstrating how Musk's ventures amplify each other and fuel optimism for Tesla's role in advancing humanity through cutting-edge tech and sustainable energy.

Dan: Amplifying everything – that's the magic! Wrapping up the news items with this from TS2 Tech: "Tesla (TSLA) Rises Above $400 as Arizona OKs Robotaxi Service and Musk’s xAI Targets $15 Billion." TSLA surpassed $400 after Arizona approved Robotaxi testing and xAI eyed that $15 billion in funding, blending autonomy progress with AI ambitions. This dual boost counters recent doubts and signals momentum. Regulatory wins like this pave the way for Tesla's vision of self-driving fleets, making transportation safer, more efficient, and accessible to all. [mind blown]

Patrick: Arizona approval – that's a game-changer, Dan! Now, let's geek out on these hottest X posts. First, Piper Sandler on Tesla FSD Advancements, posted by Sawyer Merritt. Analyst Alex Potter praised Tesla's FSD v14 as potentially outperforming human drivers, urging investors to try it. Highlights those rapid software improvements in autonomy, validating Tesla's tech edge and inspiring confidence that FSD will transform mobility and create immense value for society.

Dan: Outperforming humans? That's the future right there! Next, Tesla Expands U.S. Rental Program, again from Sawyer Merritt. They're rolling out an expanded rental program with unlimited miles, free Supercharging, and purchase discounts across models. Prices start at $60 a day for Model 3 and Y. Makes Tesla vehicles more accessible, encouraging widespread adoption and showcasing the joy of EV driving to new audiences. Who wouldn't jump on that?

Patrick: Unlimited miles – sign me up! Then there's Elon Musk on xAI and Tesla Synergy, straight from the man himself. He tweeted about how xAI's funding will accelerate Tesla's AI integrations for better autonomy, expressing excitement for the combined impact. Musk's vision unites these companies, inspiring breakthroughs that could redefine AI in everyday life and boost TSLA's long-term growth.

Dan: United visions – that's Elon-level genius! Rumors of Tesla's New Battery Tech from Tesla Owners account. They shared rumors of advanced battery developments aiming for 500-mile range in upcoming models, with high community buzz on potential announcements. If true, this could solidify Tesla's EV leadership, inspiring a shift to sustainable energy and reducing global carbon footprints. 500 miles? That's insane range!

Patrick: Insane and inspiring – can't wait for confirmation. Elon Musk Teases Cybertruck Updates, another from Elon. He hinted at software updates for Cybertruck enhancing off-road capabilities and FSD features, with fans abuzz with speculation. These enhancements keep Tesla at the forefront of innovation, motivating owners and investors to dream big about the future of rugged, electric mobility.

Dan: Cybertruck off-road upgrades? My inner adventurer is hyped! Analyst Buzz on TSLA Stock Surge from TSLA Fan. An investor posted about TSLA's rise due to Trump tax comments, predicting further gains, and the post gained traction with positive replies. Positive sentiment like this amplifies market confidence, encouraging more people to invest in Tesla's mission for a sustainable planet.

Patrick: Amplifying the positivity – love the community vibe. Tesla Diner Conversion Update from Tesla News. Reports on X about Tesla's Diner converting to a full-service restaurant by January, blending dining with EV culture. This creative expansion humanizes Tesla's brand, inspiring community spaces that promote innovation and electric lifestyles.

Dan: EV culture at a diner? That's next-level fun! FSD V14.1.7 Rollout Excitement from FSD Beta. Users shared joy over FSD v14.1.7 deploying to more vehicles, including Cybertruck, with improved performance.

Patrick: Safer roads for everyone – that's the dream. xAI Megapacks Installation from xAI Updates. The post detailed xAI installing $375 million worth of Tesla Megapacks for its supercomputer, enabling exponential AI growth. This partnership showcases Tesla's energy solutions powering AI, inspiring advancements that benefit humanity's progress.

Dan: $375 million in Megapacks? That's powering the AI revolution! And finally, Tesla Supercharger Milestone from EV Enthusiast. Celebrating Tesla hitting 75,000 Supercharger stalls worldwide, expanding charging infrastructure. This milestone eases range anxiety, inspiring more drivers to switch to EVs and contribute to a cleaner environment. Global reach – Tesla's everywhere!

Patrick: Everywhere and growing – what a network! Alright, Dan, time for the Short Squeeze graveyard roast. You know I love when you take the lead on roasting those bears.

Dan: Oh, Patrick, the bears are in shambles again! In the world of Tesla, short sellers have often underestimated the company's resilience, leading to epic short squeezes that reward believers. For instance, a prominent short seller predicted in early 2025 that TSLA would crash below $300 due to EV market saturation, but instead, shares surged past $410 on AI and policy news, failing spectacularly as Tesla's diversification proved unbreakable. Another failed call from November 18 claimed Robotaxi delays would tank the stock to $350, yet Arizona approvals and xAI buzz drove gains, highlighting how shorts overlook Tesla's innovative momentum and resulting in massive losses for doubters while inspiring long-term investors. Take that, shorts – your predictions are dust! [laughs]

Patrick: Dust indeed – believers win every time! Wrapping up with today's inspirational quote: "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower." - Steve Jobs.
