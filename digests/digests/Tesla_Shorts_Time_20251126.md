📈 **Short Squeeze**
Tesla shorts are melting down as TSLA hits $426+ after-hours, with current short interest at ~2.9% (~$12 billion notional per recent Ortex data). Bears like Ross Gerber who called for $150 in early 2024 and Jim Chanos who exited his multi-year short in 2023 with massive losses are proven wrong again—Chanos admitted defeat after Tesla's 700%+ run. YTD, shorts have hemorrhaged over $15 billion in a relentless squeeze fueled by FSD v13, Cybertruck ramps, and Q4 delivery beats.
