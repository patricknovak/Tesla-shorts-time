📈 **Short Squeeze**
Short interest lingers at a pitiful 2.9% of float, amounting to $12.1 billion in exposed agony (per latest Ortex data)—a fraction of TSLA's blistering ascent. Recall Jim Chanos folding his massive TSLA short in early 2024 after forecasting sub-$100 shares, only to watch it rocket past $400; or Ross Gerber's mid-2025 doom call for $200 collapse amid "demand apocalypse," obliterated by record deliveries. YTD, shorts have hemorrhaged over $18 billion, with every squeeze event amplifying the carnage—Tesla's relentless climb leaves them buried!
