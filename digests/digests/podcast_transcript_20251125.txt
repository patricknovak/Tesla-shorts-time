Patrick: And now, it’s time for everyone’s favourite segment — the Short Squeeze! Oh man, Tesla shorts are getting torched yet again as TSLA skyrockets, with short interest hovering at about 2.3 percent of the float, that's a whopping 25 billion dollars on the line based on fresh CNBC data. Remember back in 2023 when Bill Gates threw down a massive bet against Tesla, only to bleed billions as TSLA blasted past 200 dollars? Ha, or David Einhorn in 2024, boldly predicting a Tesla demand implosion that fizzled into nothing, forcing epic short covering? These bears have piled up over 15 billion in losses year-to-date—talk about a brutal lesson in underestimating Tesla's innovation streak. Betting against their autonomy and energy booms? It's a recipe for more agony ahead, and I can't help but chuckle at how spectacularly wrong they've been time and again.
