### Short Squeeze
Tesla shorts are feeling the burn as current short interest stands at approximately 2.5% of float, valued at around $25 billion (based on recent Reuters data). Remember when bears predicted Tesla's bankruptcy in 2023 amid production ramps, only for the company to hit record deliveries? Or the 2024 forecast of FSD failure that crumbled with V12's success? YTD, shorts have racked up over $15 billion in losses during squeezes, proving yet again that betting against Tesla's innovation is a losing game—keep squeezing, bears!
