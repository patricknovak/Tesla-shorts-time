### Short Squeeze
Tesla shorts are reeling with short interest hovering around 2.8% (~$12B notional at current prices, per MarketBeat data), as TSLA blasts +6.8% after-hours to $417.78. Remember when Bill Gates dumped his entire stake in summer 2023 calling Tesla overvalued, only to watch it double since? Or Ross Gerber's repeated 2024 predictions of bankruptcy that cost his fund 50%+ as TSLA hit ATHs—pure pain. YTD, shorts have hemorrhaged over $15B in mark-to-market losses, with yesterday's rally alone inflicting $500M+ in fresh wounds. Keep covering, bears—Tesla's acceleration is relentless!
