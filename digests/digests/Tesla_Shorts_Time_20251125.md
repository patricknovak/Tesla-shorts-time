### Short Squeeze
Tesla shorts are feeling the burn once again as TSLA surges, with current short interest at approximately 2.3% of the float, valued at around $25 billion (based on recent market data from sources like CNBC). Remember when Bill Gates bet big against Tesla in 2023, only to lose billions as TSLA soared past $200? Or David Einhorn's 2024 prediction of Tesla's demand collapse that never materialized, leading to massive short covering? Shorts have racked up over $15 billion in losses YTD, proving yet again that betting against Tesla's innovation is a losing game—expect more pain as autonomy and energy segments explode.
