Patrick: Alright, folks, let's dive right into the top news items buzzing around Tesla today. I'm Patrick here in Vancouver, and man, oh man, these stories have me fired up like a Supercharger on a cold Canadian morning. We're talking global wins, expansions, and some cheeky workarounds that just scream Tesla ingenuity. Buckle up, because we're going through them all, no holds barred.

Patrick: First up, and this one's got me grinning from ear to ear: "Tesla Model 3 Wins Best Passenger Car in New Zealand!" Oh yeah, according to Tesla North, the refreshed Model 3 just snagged the title of Best Passenger Car from the DRIVEN Car Guide down in New Zealand today. It's building on Tesla's stronghold in the Oceania region, really showcasing how appealing this car is to folks internationally. This could supercharge sales and amp up the brand's rep abroad, which is huge for investors watching Tesla's global EV edge grow stronger. Talk about a positive jolt for the stock as more markets jump on board!

Patrick: Next, get ready for some autonomous excitement: "Tesla Lets Europe Test FSD From the Passenger Seat!" Tesla North reports that Tesla kicked off FSD ride-alongs in Italy, France, and Germany this morning, letting Europeans hop in as passengers to try out Full Self-Driving Supervised for the very first time. This is a game-changer, folks—it could fast-track regulatory nods and get more people on board with Tesla's self-driving tech across Europe. It's all about cementing that leadership in autonomy, which means more software subscription bucks down the line and a nice boost to the stock's long-term value through pure innovation.

Patrick: Oh, and here's a massive expansion story: "Tesla Opens India’s First All-in-One Experience Centre in Gurugram!" Drive Tesla Canada says Tesla just unveiled its first integrated Tesla Centre in Gurugram, India, earlier today. This is Tesla planting a flag in one of the biggest auto markets on the planet, positioning themselves to grab a slice of the rising EV demand there. It diversifies their revenue away from the usual spots and points to some serious growth potential, which is music to investors' ears as emerging markets start pumping up the bottom line.

Patrick: Shifting gears to some SpaceX synergy: "Starlink Hardware and Accessories Now Available on Amazon!" According to Drive Tesla Canada, SpaceX's Starlink is now selling official hardware and accessories right on Amazon, making it super easy for people to get that high-speed internet setup. Even though it's SpaceX, it ties into Elon Musk's whole empire, and that shared innovation vibe indirectly lifts Tesla by building investor trust in all things Musk. Could mean good things for Tesla's stock through those satellite tech wins.

Patrick: Holiday shopping alert, Tesla style: "Tesla Black Friday Deals Roundup!" Drive Tesla Canada has the scoop on Tesla and third-party vendors rolling out Black Friday deals today on stuff like floor mats and paint protection film to spruce up your ride. These promos are all about making ownership even sweeter, potentially spiking short-term sales and locking in customer loyalty. It's a solid win for aftermarket revenue and keeps the brand buzzing during the holidays, which helps steady the stock through happy consumers.

Patrick: International truck vibes incoming: "International Tesla Cybertruck deliveries begin in South Korea!" Drive Tesla Canada reports that Tesla started handing over Cybertrucks to customers in South Korea this morning, marking the truck's debut outside North America. This opens up fresh markets, ramps up production, and brings in more global revenue—perfect for showing off Tesla's ability to scale manufacturing worldwide. A real milestone in their quest for EV world domination, and that's got to be bullish for the stock.

Patrick: Now, for a bit of drama with a Tesla twist: "Swedish union rep pissed that Tesla is working around a postal blockade they started!" Teslarati tells us a Swedish union rep is fuming because Tesla's getting creative by using private residences to snag license plates during a postal blockade that the union kicked off. But hey, this just highlights Tesla's clever problem-solving skills in the face of labor hiccups, beefing up their operational toughness. It's appealing to investors who love that adaptability, and it reinforces Tesla's stick-to-it attitude in Europe, which could fuel stock growth.

Patrick: Political buzz from Europe: "Czech Deputy excited for Tesla FSD, hints at Transport Committee review!" Per Teslarati, a Czech lawmaker is all hyped up about Tesla's FSD and is dropping hints about a possible review by the Transport Committee this morning. This shows building political backing for autonomous tech, which might speed up FSD adoption across Europe and pump up those software revenues. With regulatory barriers easing, it's a super positive signal for the stock.

Patrick: Wrapping up the news items: "Tesla pushes back on reports that they are pivoting away from Chinese suppliers!" Drive Tesla Canada says Tesla's China team clapped back yesterday evening against rumors of cutting ties with Chinese suppliers, stressing that partnerships are still going strong. This calms any jitters about the supply chain, which is key for keeping production smooth and costs in check, especially with all the geopolitical noise. It spotlights Tesla's smart global balancing act, helping protect the stock's value.

Patrick: Okay, now let's flip to the Short Spot, our daily peek at something bearish that's floating around. Today's it's "Swedish Union Frustrated with Tesla's Tactics!" Teslarati covered this one today, where a Swedish union rep is venting frustration over Tesla dodging a postal blockade by routing license plates through private homes, pointing to those pesky ongoing labor spats that might snag operations in the region. Sure, it's a short-term bump in the road for European growth, but Tesla's inventive dodges show real grit. In the end, these kinds of hurdles often just make the company tougher, turning any stock wobble into a prime buying chance.

Patrick: Ha! And speaking of shorts getting squeezed, let's jump into the Short Squeeze section with some serious glee, because oh boy, do I love seeing these predictions flop. Short sellers are still licking their wounds as Tesla keeps shattering their doomsday vibes year after year. Remember back in 2020 when the bears were all doom and gloom, swearing Tesla was headed for bankruptcy amid production headaches? Yeah, well, the stock rocketed over seven hundred percent that year on the back of record deliveries and profitability—talk about a face-plant! Or how about 2022, when they claimed rising interest rates would tank EV demand, but Tesla smashed it with one point eight million deliveries in 2023? Fast-forward to 2025, and all those forecasts of FSD getting stuck in regulatory limbo? Totally crushed by these global rollouts we're seeing now. Shorts are nursing massive losses as TSLA keeps climbing, proving yet again that betting against Tesla is just a recipe for regret. Eat your heart out, bears—Tesla's leaving you in the dust!
