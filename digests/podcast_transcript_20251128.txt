Patrick: Welcome to Tesla Shorts Time Daily, episode 332. It is November 28, 2025 at 10:35 AM PST. I'm Patrick in Vancouver, Canada. TSLA stock price is $430.17 right now in after-hours trading. Thank you for joining us today. If you like the show, please like, share, rate and subscribe to the podcast, it really helps. Now straight to the daily news updates you are here for.

Patrick: Alright, folks, let's dive right into the top news items buzzing around Tesla today. I'm pumped because these stories are showing just how unstoppable this company is. Starting off with number one: Tesla Opens India’s First All-in-One Experience Centre in Gurugram! Oh man, this is huge! According to Drive Tesla Canada, Tesla has just launched its very first integrated center in Gurugram, Haryana, and it's a game-changer for the Indian market. This place has everything—sales, service, and delivery all in one spot. It's a big step in expanding Tesla's presence globally, especially as India's demand for electric vehicles is skyrocketing. This could really pump up their international revenue and give the stock a nice boost as more people jump on the EV bandwagon.

Patrick: Moving on to number two, and this one's got me grinning: Starlink Hardware and Accessories Now Available on Amazon! Yes! Drive Tesla Canada reports that SpaceX's Starlink is making it easier than ever to get their gear by selling official hardware like dishes and routers straight on Amazon. This is opening up high-speed internet to folks all over the world, and it's bound to supercharge Starlink's user base. Plus, with the synergies in Elon's whole ecosystem, this indirectly lifts Tesla too, building that investor confidence through all those diversified revenue streams.

Patrick: Number three is firing me up—autonomous driving is taking over Europe! Tesla FSD Supervised ride-alongs in Europe begin in Italy, France, and Germany! Teslarati is all over this, saying Tesla is now offering public observer rides with FSD Supervised in these countries, letting non-drivers hop in and experience the self-driving magic in city environments. It's a brilliant way to show off their AI tech, and it could smooth the path for regulatory nods, pushing Tesla's value sky-high in the autonomous vehicle world.

Patrick: Oh, and number four? International expansion at its finest: International Tesla Cybertruck deliveries begin in South Korea! Drive Tesla Canada has the scoop—Tesla's now handing over Cybertrucks to customers in South Korea, the first time this beast is rolling out beyond North America. This really spotlights Tesla's ability to manufacture and deliver globally, and it's set to unlock new markets, fueling sales growth and solidifying their rep as innovators, which means good things for the stock in the long run.

Patrick: Number five has a bit of drama, and I love how Tesla's handling it: Swedish union rep pissed that Tesla is working around a postal blockade they started! Teslarati details how Tesla Sweden is cleverly dodging a union-orchestrated postal blockade by using private addresses for license plates, keeping those vehicle deliveries flowing without a hitch. It's a testament to Tesla's toughness in the face of labor issues, which should help keep their European operations humming along smoothly and support steady market performance.

Patrick: Political buzz incoming for number six: Czech Deputy excited for Tesla FSD, hints at Transport Committee review! This is exciting stuff from Teslarati—a Czech lawmaker is hyping up Tesla's FSD tech on social media and even suggesting the transport committee might review it to speed things along. Support like this from politicians could fast-track regulations across Europe, strengthening Tesla's lead in autonomous driving and getting investors even more optimistic.

Patrick: Number seven is Tesla setting the record straight: Tesla pushes back on reports that they are pivoting away from Chinese suppliers! Drive Tesla Canada says Tesla's China team is pushing back hard against media stories claiming they're cutting ties with Chinese suppliers, instead stressing that their partnerships are as strong as ever. This kind of reassurance is key for keeping the supply chain stable, which helps with efficient production, controlling costs, and maintaining competitive prices— all of which bolsters the stock's resilience.

Patrick: Awards season for number eight: Tesla Model 3 named New Zealand’s best passenger car of 2025! Teslarati reports that the Model 3 just snagged the title of New Zealand's top passenger car for 2025, thanks in part to the fresh rollout of FSD Supervised there. This win really highlights Tesla's tech edge and how appealing their cars are to buyers, which should spark more sales worldwide and keep shareholders feeling great about the momentum.

Patrick: And wrapping up the top news with number nine: Tesla starts rolling out FSD V14.2.1 to AI4 vehicles including Cybertruck! Hot off the presses from Teslarati—Tesla's pushing out FSD version 14.2.1 to cars with AI4 hardware, and yes, that includes the Cybertruck, right on the heels of the 14.2 release. These quick updates show how Tesla's constantly refining their AI, cementing their spot as the top dog in self-driving tech and likely ramping up those subscription revenues.

Patrick: Now, shifting gears to our Short Spot section, where we look at potential headwinds that shorts might latch onto, but honestly, Tesla's got this. The title here is Tesla Faces Pushback Reports on Supplier Shift! From Drive Tesla Canada yesterday evening, there were reports floating around suggesting Tesla's moving away from Chinese suppliers, which could mess with supply chains and jack up costs, especially with all the geopolitical stuff going on. But Tesla quickly denied it, highlighting their ongoing solid partnerships, so this seems like just a fleeting media blip that's probably way overblown and won't touch their long-term efficiency.

Patrick: Haha, oh man, now for the part that always makes my day—the Short Squeeze! Short sellers are still getting absolutely torched as Tesla keeps proving the naysayers wrong, year after year. Remember back in 2020? Bears like Jim Chanos were dead certain Tesla was heading for bankruptcy because of production hiccups, but nope—the stock rocketed over seven hundred percent that year alone, according to CNBC, leaving shorts nursing massive losses. Then in 2022, during those supply chain squeezes, skeptics piled on the bets against Tesla, only to watch billions evaporate as Cybertruck excitement and FSD breakthroughs sent shares soaring, per Bloomberg. And here we are in 2025, with all those failed predictions about EV market saturation getting totally ignored thanks to killer moves like Cybertruck deliveries kicking off in South Korea. Short interest is still sky-high, but Tesla's unbreakable spirit is squeezing those pessimists dry—glee doesn't even cover it, folks, this is pure schadenfreude!
