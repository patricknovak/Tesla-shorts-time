It's that candid, thoughtful vibe that really pulls the community in deep. This authentic stuff strengthens Elon's bond with Tesla supporters, building that loyal fanbase that spreads the word and keeps the stock tough through any storm. Buzz level: off the charts!

Patrick: Third: Protecting the Innocent: Elon's Vital Stance! Holy cow, this is vital – hyping up this morning's retweet of "We must protect the innocent..." which shows Elon's rock-solid commitment to ethics, and everyone's nodding along! In the Tesla world, it's underlining his principled business style that earns trust and makes the company a true force for good.

Maximum excitement for this morning's retweet where Elon calls out falsely labeling people as incitement to murder – tackling tough societal stuff head-on! For Tesla, it spotlights Elon's place in these big conversations, ramping up visibility and drawing in a diverse crowd that sharpens the company's innovative edge. Controversy? Nah, this is conversation fuel!

Oh man, this is getting real – hyping this morning's retweet of "Troubling..." where Elon points out some concerning trends, and it's kicking off major discussions! Linking back to Tesla, it's all about his forward-thinking brain that's driven the company to EV domination. It sparks optimism for future wins and stock upside – troubling times? Elon turns them into triumphs!

Patrick: Alright, shifting gears a bit – we've got our Short Spot today, that one bearish nugget to keep things balanced. Elon's Political Commentary Stirs Debate! This morning, from @attentionweare on X, there's this retweet of Elon's statement about how falsely labeling folks as "fascist" or "Nazi" is basically incitement to murder. It's diving into some heated political waters, and critics are saying it might polarize Tesla's customers and create short-term brand hiccups. But hey, these moments are usually just blips – Elon's bold vision has turned controversy into innovation fuel before, and Tesla comes out stronger, more resilient in the market every time.

Patrick: Ha ha, and now, the part that makes me gleeful every time – the Short Squeeze! Oh, short sellers, how are you feeling today? With Tesla's unstoppable momentum, the current short interest is at three point two percent of the float, valued at fifty point two billion dollars – that's leaving those bears wide open to more pain if the stock keeps climbing! Remember that epic fail from 2020? Investor Jim Chanos shorted Tesla, predicting bankruptcy because of production issues, but nope – Tesla hit profitability and rocketed in a massive rally, squeezing those shorts dry! And don't forget 2023, when analyst Gordon Johnson bet on Tesla's downfall from demand slowdowns, only for record deliveries to prove him totally wrong, hammering shorts even harder! Year-to-date, these poor shorts have racked up estimated losses over fifteen billion dollars as TSLA just defies gravity. Spectacular failures all around – glee levels are maxed out here in Vancouver!
