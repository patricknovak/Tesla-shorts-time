Thank you for joining us today. If you like the show, please like, share, rate and subscribe to the podcast, it really helps. Now straight to the daily news updates you are here for.  

Patrick: Oh man, folks, buckle up because we've got an absolute powerhouse of Tesla news today that's got me buzzing like I've just chugged a double espresso from Tim Hortons! We're diving into the top stories that are lighting up the EV world, and trust me, as your hyper-enthusiastic scientist buddy here in Vancouver, I'm losing my mind over how Tesla keeps pushing boundaries. Let's kick it off with the first one!  

Patrick: Alright, number one: "Tesla pushes back on reports that they are pivoting away from Chinese suppliers" – whoa, this is huge, from yesterday evening via Drive Tesla Canada! So, get this, Tesla's executive team in China is straight-up countering this Wall Street Journal report that claimed the company was planning to cut back on relying on Chinese suppliers. They're emphasizing that their partnerships are rock-solid and ongoing, which really underscores Tesla's dedication to keeping their global supply chain stable and efficient. I mean, in a world full of geopolitical ups and downs, this kind of commitment could seriously boost investor confidence, help with production costs, and keep that stock resilient. No wonder Tesla's always a step ahead – they're not letting rumors slow them down!  

Patrick: Moving right along to number two: "Tesla Model 3 named New Zealand’s best passenger car of 2025" – yes! This just dropped yesterday afternoon from Teslarati, and I'm pumping my fist here! The Tesla Model 3 has snagged the title of New Zealand's top passenger car for 2025, and a big shoutout to the rollout of those Full Self-Driving Supervised features that are supercharging its advanced tech game. This award is a massive nod to Tesla's lead in electric vehicle innovation and how darn appealing their cars are to drivers everywhere. It's the kind of win that could spark even more sales internationally and keep that positive momentum rolling for the stock. Kiwis know a winner when they see one, eh?  

Patrick: Number three has me geeking out hard: "Tesla starts rolling out FSD V14.2.1 to AI4 vehicles including Cybertruck" – oh boy, yesterday afternoon via Teslarati again, and this is next-level! Tesla's pushing out Full Self-Driving version 14.2.1 to vehicles equipped with AI4 hardware, including the beastly Cybertruck, hot on the heels of the initial V14.2 update. This quick-fire iteration shows just how fast Tesla is advancing in autonomous driving tech – it's like they're evolving in real time! Updates like this could seriously up the value of their vehicles, draw in more subscribers to FSD, and pump up future revenue, which spells good news for the stock. If you're a Tesla owner, check your app – this could be coming your way!  

Patrick: Okay, number four: "Tessie Launches Black Friday Deal: Lifetime Licenses Are Back" – Black Friday madness, folks! This hit yesterday afternoon from Tesla North, and it's a deal that's got me excited for all you Tesla app enthusiasts. The third-party app Tessie, which is hailed as one of the best companions for everyday Tesla use, has brought back their Black Friday promotion with lifetime licenses on offer. This kind of deal could really amp up user engagement within the Tesla ecosystem, fostering even stronger brand loyalty. And hey, when the community thrives, it indirectly lifts the stock through all that grassroots adoption. If you've been eyeing Tessie, now's the time – don't sleep on it!  

Patrick: Number five is a mind-blower: "Waymo rider data hints that Tesla’s Cybercab strategy might be the smartest, after all" – vindication station! From yesterday afternoon on Teslarati, this one's got me grinning ear to ear. Rider data from Waymo is basically validating Tesla's choice to go with a two-seat design for the Cybercab, pushing back against earlier criticisms by showing that people prefer efficient, solo-oriented robotaxi rides. It's proof positive of Tesla's smart, forward-thinking take on autonomous mobility, setting them up to dominate the robotaxi space and drive long-term stock growth. Elon and team called it – efficiency wins the day!  

Patrick: Shifting gears to number six: "SpaceX Puts Starlink Hardware on Amazon for the First Time" – crossover alert! This came out yesterday afternoon from Tesla North, and as a science nerd, I'm loving the synergies here. SpaceX, under Elon Musk's umbrella, has started selling Starlink hardware directly on Amazon, making it easier for folks in the U.S. to get their hands on it and simplifying the whole customer acquisition process. Since this ties into the broader Musk ventures, it could amplify those ecosystem connections with Tesla, boosting overall investor optimism and helping lift the stock through deeper tech integration. Starlink on Amazon? That's accessibility on steroids!  

Patrick: Number seven: "Tesla Begins Cybertruck Deliveries in First Overseas Market" – international expansion, baby! Yesterday morning from Tesla North, and this has me hyped for global domination. Tesla's kicked off deliveries of the Cybertruck in South Korea, marking the truck's very first venture into an overseas market. This is a big milestone that widens Tesla's global presence, potentially ramping up export revenues and making the stock even more attractive as demand heats up in fresh territories. South Korea, welcome to the Cybertruck revolution – it's only the beginning!  

Patrick: Number eight is close to home for us Canucks: "Tesla Adds Two New Potential Canadian Supercharger Locations in November 2025 Map Update" – yes, eh! From yesterday morning via Drive Tesla Canada, Tesla's updated their Supercharger map for Canada, tossing in two new sites that are now "in development" to beef up the charging network. This kind of expansion is key for pushing greater EV adoption up here in the Great White North, giving Tesla a stronger edge with their infrastructure and contributing to that steady stock growth through better user experiences. More Superchargers mean more road trips without the range anxiety – let's go, Canada!  

Patrick: And wrapping up the top news with number nine: "Tesla Reaches 20,000 Vehicles in New Zealand" – milestone alert! This one from early yesterday morning on Drive Tesla Canada, and it's a testament to Tesla's growing empire. Tesla has hit the impressive mark of 20,000 vehicles cruising the roads in New Zealand, celebrating some serious regional expansion. This shows off their strong market penetration and brand power, which should keep the sales momentum going and add a positive vibe to the global stock story. 20,000 Teslas down under? That's accelerating sustainable energy in style!  

Patrick: Alright, now let's dip into the Short Spot – the one bearish blip in an otherwise stellar day. "WSJ Report Sparks Supply Chain Concerns" from yesterday evening via Drive Tesla Canada. So, this Wall Street Journal report floated the idea that Tesla is dialing back on Chinese suppliers, which stirred up some fears about possible disruptions or jacked-up costs. But hold on, Tesla pushed back hard, stressing their stable partnerships, so this feels like a short-lived overreaction from the bears. Tesla's nimble supply chain is built to handle this and keep the growth engine humming – don't let the naysayers fool you!  

Patrick: Ha! And now, my favorite part – the Short Squeeze! Oh, shorts, you poor souls, you're getting torched as Tesla just keeps defying gravity with nonstop innovation and total market domination. Their positions are drowning underwater, and it's glorious to watch. Remember back in 2020 when Jim Chanos, that famous short seller, bet big against Tesla, predicting they'd go bankrupt? Yeah, well, the stock skyrocketed over 700 percent that year alone – ouch! Or how about in 2023, when Gordon Johnson was screaming that Tesla's demand was collapsing and the stock would plummet to $24? Nope, it rebounded like a champ, proving him dead wrong yet again. These epic fails just show why betting against Elon Musk's vision is a recipe for regret. Year-to-date, shorts have piled up over $20 billion in losses, and with the current short interest at 3.2 percent valued at $50.2 billion, those recent price gains are dishing out even more pain. Squeeze on, baby – Tesla's unstoppable!  

Patrick: Time for some inspiration with today's quote: "If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. Otherwise, it's not." – Elon Musk.
