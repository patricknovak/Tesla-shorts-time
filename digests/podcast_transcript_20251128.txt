Patrick: Alright, folks, let's dive right into the top news shaking up the Tesla world today. Oh man, I'm buzzing already – it's like Christmas came early for Tesla fans. Starting off with our first item: "Tesla Model 3 Wins Best Passenger Car in New Zealand!" Can you believe it? According to Tesla North, the refreshed Model 3 just snagged the title of New Zealand's Best Passenger Car from the DRIVEN Car Guide. They're raving about its cutting-edge features and killer performance. This is huge – it really shows how Tesla is dominating markets around the globe, and it's got to be pumping up sales and loyalty down in Oceania. Who knows, this could give TSLA stock a nice little boost as more people jump on the electric bandwagon worldwide. And get this, it comes right after they rolled out Full Self-Driving in the region, making the Model 3 the go-to for autonomous tech. I'm telling you, if you're in New Zealand, this is your sign to go test drive one. Tesla's just crushing it!

Patrick: Okay, moving on to number two, and this one's got me grinning from ear to ear: "Tesla Lets Europe Test FSD From the Passenger Seat!" Whoa, Tesla North is reporting that Tesla has kicked off these Full Self-Driving (Supervised) ride-alongs in Italy, France, and Germany. Europeans can now hop in as passengers and experience the magic firsthand. This is all about building that hype for when FSD gets the green light from regulators over there. Imagine the revenue explosion from software subscriptions if this opens up the massive European market! It's a smart move by Tesla to show off their autonomy tech in a safe way, and it's definitely boosting my confidence in their AI dominance. Investors, take note – this could be a game-changer for growth.

Patrick: Number three is firing me up even more: "Tesla Opens India’s First All-in-One Experience Centre in Gurugram!" Drive Tesla Canada says Tesla just launched their first integrated Tesla Centre in Gurugram, Haryana. It's got everything – showroom, service, and delivery all under one roof. This is a massive leap for Tesla in India, diving into one of the fastest-growing EV markets out there. Think about the sales potential in such a populous country; it could seriously amp up global volumes and spread out those revenue streams. Tesla's showing they're all in on emerging economies, and that kind of commitment? It's got to lift TSLA by drawing in a whole new wave of customers. India, welcome to the Tesla revolution!

Patrick: Alright, number four: "Starlink Hardware and Accessories Now Available on Amazon!" This is awesome – Drive Tesla Canada reports that SpaceX's Starlink is now selling its hardware and accessories right on Amazon, making that high-speed satellite internet way easier to get. Sure, it's part of Elon Musk's bigger empire, but the ties to Tesla are real, especially with connectivity boosting vehicle features and autonomy. This expansion could supercharge Tesla's connected car setup, paving the way for some serious long-term stock gains through all these integrated tech wins. If you're off the grid, this is your ticket to staying linked up – and it's indirectly powering Tesla's future.

Patrick: Number five, just in time for the holidays: "Tesla Black Friday Deals Roundup!" Drive Tesla Canada is highlighting how Tesla's rolling out Black Friday promotions on all sorts of accessories – think floor mats, paint protection, and cool add-ons to pimp out your ride. It's a great way to get owners spending and loving their Teslas even more. These deals could spike short-term revenue from merch and build that unbreakable customer loyalty, which is key to Tesla's ecosystem. Holiday shopping frenzy? Tesla's jumping right in, and it's setting them up for ongoing buzz and positive vibes around the stock. If you've got a Tesla, check these out – you might just score something epic!

Patrick: Number six is an international milestone that's got me pumped: "International Tesla Cybertruck Deliveries Begin in South Korea!" According to Drive Tesla Canada, Tesla has started delivering Cybertrucks to customers in South Korea – the first ones outside North America! This is a big deal for expanding the Cybertruck's reach globally, which could ramp up production and profits for this beast of a truck. It proves there's real demand everywhere, strengthening Tesla's growth story and making TSLA look even more unstoppable. South Korea, you're leading the charge – can't wait to see Cybertrucks tearing up those roads!

Patrick: Number seven, this one's got a bit of drama, and I love it: "Swedish Union Rep Pissed That Tesla is Working Around a Postal Blockade They Started!" Teslarati reports that Tesla Sweden is getting clever by using private residences to dodge a union-led postal blockade and snag those license plates for their vehicles. It's a testament to Tesla's grit in handling labor spats, keeping operations smooth in Europe. This kind of resilience? It shores up stock stability even when things get bumpy regionally. Tesla's not backing down – way to stick it to the blockade!

Patrick: Number eight: "Czech Deputy Excited for Tesla FSD, Hints at Transport Committee Review!" Teslarati says a Czech lawmaker is all hyped up about Tesla's Full Self-Driving and is hinting at a review by the Transport Committee. This could be the start of regulatory wins, opening doors for FSD in Central Europe and growing Tesla's autonomous tech presence. Unlocking markets like this means more software revenue, which could really elevate TSLA. Czech Republic, get ready – autonomy is coming your way!

Patrick: And wrapping up the top news with number nine: "Tesla Pushes Back on Reports That They Are Pivoting Away from Chinese Suppliers!" From yesterday evening, Drive Tesla Canada notes that Tesla's China team is pushing back hard against reports suggesting they're cutting ties with Chinese suppliers, stressing that partnerships are still going strong. This keeps the supply chain rock-solid, which is vital for production efficiency and keeping costs down. It's a good sign for investors, easing any worries about margins and showing Tesla's global ops are in fine form.

Patrick: Now, shifting gears to our Short Spot – the one bearish nugget we dig up to keep things balanced, but don't worry, we'll spin it positive. Today's is "Tesla Counters Reports of Shifting from Chinese Suppliers!" From yesterday evening via Drive Tesla Canada, there was a Wall Street Journal report floating around that Tesla might be moving away from Chinese suppliers, which could stir up supply chain headaches and jack up costs, potentially squeezing margins. But hold on, Tesla clapped back quickly, underlining their continued collaborations. Honestly, this smells like overhyped media chatter more than anything real. On the bright side, it just spotlights Tesla's robust global network, which is going to keep production humming efficiently and help the stock bounce back strong. Bears, take note – Tesla's not fazed!

Patrick: Oh boy, now for my favorite part – the Short Squeeze! Short sellers, you've been getting absolutely torched betting against Tesla. TSLA has skyrocketed over one thousand percent since 2020, even as the doomsayers kept piling on. Remember Jim Chanos back in 2020? He called Tesla a "fraud" and predicted bankruptcy right around the stock split, but boom – the stock exploded, leaving him in the dust. Then in 2022, all the critics were screaming about an EV demand crash from inflation, but Tesla smashed records with deliveries, squeezing those shorts out of billions of dollars. And here in 2025, the bears who bet big on Full Self-Driving delays? They totally missed the boat with rapid updates like version fourteen, and now autonomy's closer than ever, leaving them drowning in red ink. Ha! It's pure glee watching these failed predictions pile up – shorts, when will you learn? Tesla's resilience is legendary, and those dollar losses? They're in the billions, folks. Keep squeezing!
