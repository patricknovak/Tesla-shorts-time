### Short Squeeze – TSLAQ Graveyard
Remember when Gordon Johnson repeatedly called TSLA a "zero" and predicted bankruptcy by 2020, or Jim Chanos labeled it the biggest fraud since Enron while shorting it into oblivion? David Einhorn's "FSD is a fraud" rants and endless bear claims like "Cybertruck will flop" or "Robotaxi is vaporware" have been buried under today's reality: TSLA at $404 with a $1.3T market cap, Cybertruck as America's #3 best-selling EV, FSD v14 driving millions of real miles, and Robotaxi prototypes hitting roads—proving the shorts' graveyard is overflowing while Tesla accelerates toward full autonomy and energy dominance.
