### Short Squeeze
In the ongoing saga of Tesla short sellers, many have faced massive losses from failed bearish predictions. For instance, in 2020, prominent short seller Jim Chanos predicted Tesla's demise due to overvaluation and competition, but TSLA surged over 700% that year as production ramped up and profits soared [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/jim-chanos-converts-tesla-short-position-to-put-options.html); this failed because Tesla's innovation and market dominance outpaced doubts. Similarly, David Einhorn's 2018 call for Tesla's collapse amid cash burn ignored the company's scaling prowess, leading to his fund's underperformance as TSLA hit new highs [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-24/einhorn-laments-tesla-s-fraud-and-weak-demand-for-model-3); these examples show how underestimating Elon Musk's vision and Tesla's execution has repeatedly triggered short squeezes, rewarding long-term believers.
